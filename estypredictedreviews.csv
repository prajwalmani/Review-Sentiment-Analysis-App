            This came out wayyy better than I expected! I used these ear climbers for my wedding and they were super cute. The only reason I didn�t give 5 stars is because I lost 1 ear climber at the end of the day. :( I know I had put it on correctly and tightened it, but it didn�t hold up. Otherwise, the earrings are still great!

            An absolutely beautiful piece of jewellery. I had to wear them as soon as they arrived! I have had multiple compliments on them and they are my new favourite pair. Blown away with the speed of delivery considering where the jewellery was coming from. 
Would definitely buy from here again!

            It was packaged nice and was delivered to me in a timely manner. The 925 Silver is shiny and very beautiful. However, I do think that these specific ones don't compliment my ear shape very well. They also would slide off my ear occasionally throughout my day when I would wear them. *5 stars for the fast shipping, reasonable prices, and secure packaging. Definitely looking forward to trying out some other styles of earrings and ear climbers from this shop in the future.

            These are beautiful and everything I was hoping for. I wore them to my college graduation and had many compliments and people asking where I got them. They are a bit difficult to get in at first and are EXTREMELY fragile, so they are definitely not for everyday wear. If you are looking for an earring you can just put in and forget about then these are not for you. But, if you're looking for a beautiful and unique piece of jewelry to make you stand out and look Awesome, then these are it. 

I especially loved the package they were delivered in. Just magical!

            So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fianc�s wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It�s so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.

�This ring is everything I�ve ever wanted. It�s perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven�t had it on a full 24 hours and can�t even count how many people have said �that is by far the most beautiful ring I�ve ever seen.��

He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!

            I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit.

But that's getting better with practice.

            I bought this piece along with another ear jacket. I have to say, I am OBSESSED. I am really into minimalistic jewelry and I�m always looking for more jewelry that�s simple but not boring. Every time I try to find minimalist earrings I just find simple balls or gems, and I�m not a fan. These are perfect. They are simple and understated but actually an interesting design, unlike so much of what I find. Gold Spoon, keep doing you, you�re making minimalism more interesting.

            This is the 4th time I�ve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren�t made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you�ll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear

            These are beautiful, quality, and hand crafted. I love them. They are stunning and unique. Very excited for my wedding day. My only recommendation for the shop owner is to post a photo of the back of the earring. I did not realize it had a stud and a clip on section (makes sense given its design; very practical!). I also like that I can adjust the strength of the clip on part. They are a bit heavier than you might expect, so if you have sensitive ears, you might want to go a bit smaller.

            I love my ear climbers! They are som comfortable and exactly what I was looking for in my second hole. I used to not be able to wear earrings in the second hole because they would get irritated from the backs. So this solved my problem because there is no �back�, it just slips on and stays put! I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven�t taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they  originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in. So just a heads up the shipping took quite a long time! But I did eventually receive item and seller was very helpful in making sure they were received.

            The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think.

            Wonderful and responsive seller. These are easily one of my new favorite earrings (and included was a sweet midi ring, which I love!). Not only that, but shipping was super-fast and everything was carefully packaged into a sturdy little box and wrapped in felt. This is a shop that cares about the customer, and it shows. Definitely recommend!

            Die Ohrklemmen wurden sehr schnell geliefert. Sie sind kleiner als erwartet, sehen am Ohr aber perfekt aus.

            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)

            People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!

The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!

            I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!

Be advised that the two ""jacket"" sections are textured on the same side (not mirror-images of each other), so when you flip one to wear it, they are slightly different.

            Such cute earrings! I ordered silver, however when I received them they were gold with purple pinwheels. However I just bought some paint from Ben Franklin and painted the pinwheels blue and the sticks silver, to match my wedding colors.

nThe pinwheels actually spin - SO CUTE! Love these earrings.

            I love how the colour looks like in the product picture so I just choose the same colour ""Multicolor"". Now I quote the seller's words when he replied my question about ""Multicolor"": ""When I make a pair of pinwheel earrings in multicolor the color shades are blue - violet - gold at the bottom of the windmill and gold - teal on the top."" So the real products don't really have the same look as in the picture, but they are still beautiful, with ombre effect ;)

            These are amazing, beautiful, fun, and vibrant earrings! The shape and colour were exact to the photos advertised. The gold hardware are a pretty touch and definitely add extra elegance to the earrings. 

The size are good, they�re a perfect size for an accent or statement. They�re also pretty light, and easy to wear ( not heavy, don�t feel agitating, simple backing ). 

The packaging was pretty, a high quality business card, simple tissue, and a cute brand sticker. 

The shipping took longer than I expected but it could have been the long processing time. 

Overall they�re gorgeous and I would definitely buy from this boutique again!

            I had not considered a pair of ear climbers before spotting these... something about the shape in the photo just spoke to me, and they are every bit as beautiful in reality. I have a fairly neutral skin tone but tend to wear silver. I bought these in the hammered gold because I reckoned this would give a softer glow of gold, which it does (and it was an occasion for spoiling myself). They feel superb in the hand and look gorgeous on. More of a subtle and elegant touch than a statement piece, I know I am going to get loads of use from them. They shipped much faster than promised too.

            BEAUTIFUL earrings! I love these earrings so much! I wore them in my wedding and received so many compliments.  The sparkles were gorgeous. I technically didn't wear them as intended with the climbing style because I realized that personally I have pretty small ears and when I put them on as so the earrings kind of flared out. So I switched sides with the earrings and allowed them to hang down. They were beyond expectations and SO beautiful. I would highly recommend these earrings and shop to anyone looking for the perfect amount of sparkle and beauty!

            I've wanted to try an ear climber for a while, but wasn't really sure how they would look on me.  I decided on this gorgeous design and I'm so glad I did.  I love them (I ordered the pair).  They are fantastic...don't hesitate if you're thinking about these!

            I love Lucie�s jewelry!! I now have two of her items that I�ve been coveting (elk antler ear climbers and cedar ring) and both were shipped out sooner than expected and arrived perfectly. The quality of her jewelry is well above what I had expected, and every piece is so delicate and beautifully detailed. I will definitely be treating myself to more of her pieces in the future! Thank you Lucie!

            Sehr sch�ne und massive Ohrstecker. Das minimalistische Design ist toll und ich wurde schon ein paar mal auf diese Ohrringe angesprochen. 
Die Stecker sind gut und sauber gearbeitet, ein wenig umst�ndlich anzuziehen (erst das Querst�ck, dann hinter dem Ohrl�ppchen das senkrechte Teil und dann den ""Stopfen""). Es sind keine Ohrringe, die man mal �ber Nacht anlassen kann, da sie schon recht massiv sind. 
 
Alles in allem finde ich sie sehr sch�n und kann sie nur weiter empfehlen. Sie kamen in einer sehr sch�nen Verpackung mit einem pers�nlichen Gru� der Verk�uferin an. Der Versand war auch okay, daf�r dass sie aus Griechenland kamen!

            Absolutely love the cuffs! They are the perfect size. They stay on my ear. I have worn them overnight and they are still on in the morning! 
The earrings are a different story. They look exactly like the picture but they are so long. They actually slide right off my ear and just dangle which looks terrible. I would recommend getting the shorter ones. But they are very dainty and seem well made. Very happy.

            I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them.

Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them.""

            Great little earrings! I was nervous because I wanted to wear these in my third holes but they are small enough that they look great even that far up my earlobe without going into the part where my ear curls over. Comfy enough to sleep in (though I usually turn them face down) which is what I wanted and it was really hard to find a climber earring that didn't have a stud back. The back also is adjustable for how tight it is which is nice and no irritation from wearing them for a long time. Highly recommend!

            I asked for flat gold discs instead of the little ball studs and was accomodated! These are high quality- you can feel it in the weight of the product. They look super cool and are what I envisioned and wanted in an ear jacket set. I really appreciate the ability to set how low or high you want the jacket to be. It's bound to be as snug or as low as you want it! Thank you so so much!!

            I LOVE these earrings! Oak leaves and acorns are my family�s thing (because of the saying �Mighty oaks from little acorns grow.�) so these earrings are very special to me. They are well made and beautiful! I�d buy the other earring set available too if the two earrings were mirror images of each other. Also, if there were a bar style necklace with a chain soldered to each side of this curved oak branch, I�d buy it too. I definitely recommend these earrings!

            I�ve been buying from here for the past few months since I�ve been able to switch up my jewelry. Very high quality, does not cause any tightness or discomfort. 

One thing I will say though, when I get the gold, it does fade a little over time into silver. It doesn�t take away from the quality of the piercing I�m assuming it�s because I still clean my piercing often. 

The titanium and silver for sure are the absolute best!

The gems are beautiful and I love the eccentric designs they have.

            Beautiful earrings. The climbers have a long back piece that is more narrow at the base than at the top. I think it is designed this way to help secure them in place but my lobe is slightly big for the narrow part. It doesn't cause much of an issue just every so often they pop out of place a bit. They took a bit of adjusting to see how they fit best on my lobe. Otherwise they look and feel great! I have been admiring these for a while so I was happy to finally take the plunge and be satisfied with my purchase :-)

They dont bother me when sleeping, which was my main reason for buying, and always look great. The only reason I�ve had to buy earrings since I first got a pair from here is because I have had them occasionally fall out and get lost- so I just replace them (love that I can buy one at a time)!

            Loved these! They are just as beautiful and sparkly in person. Wore them for my wedding day and plan to wear them for many more weddings/events I attend. The only issue was the size of the holes in the ear jacket itself. The earring posts only fit in some (not all) of the holes, so I couldn't wear them on the lower setting I wanted to (since only one side fit through). I wore them on a higher setting so the ear jacket sat lower. They still looked great, just not quite the look I was going for.

Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle

            When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped.

The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. 

Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring.

            I received the Silver ball ear jacket earrings.  They are very well made and sturdy.  The posts were fine, not too thick.  And something else noteworthy is that the back part where the balls hang is adjustable.  So if you're piercing hole is closer to the bottom of your ear lobe, you can adjust the back part so it doesn't hang too low.  Beautiful!!

            Triangle ear climber- what a great buy! I'm allergic to earrings so I have to be careful about the material, but these are as they are described which is huge! They are beautiful. Pricey- but the first earring that I can wear full time and I get so many compliments! I would suggest wearing one of these and buying the single triangle earing. It makes it an expensive buy... Wish they would make it a package deal!!

            I got these earrings for my wedding day. I tried them out during my bachelorette and found them very uncomfortable, but realized it was because had tightened the little knob on top too tight. I wore them for my wedding day, from 11AM to 12AM, and let me say I didn�t even feel them (I tightened the knob the right amount that time). Everyone loved them so much! They are beyond gorgeous and so edgy. I got the pair so my mom and I could each wear one. I�ve kept on using them for outings and everyone is always complimenting me on them! Arrived within a couple of weeks, which is a plus! Love them!

            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far!

            So cute. Can be worn as an accent piece on either ear, maybe with an ear cuff to contrast. Worn on both ears, it's cute too! Feels sturdy, and can be secured by positioning the climber to desired spot then squeezing both sides closed. I thought it might be too big for my small ears andI'm glad I took the risk cause it paid off. Love the fact it's adjustable! Love the packaging too (tiny test tube securely wrapped in bubble wrap) and the silver-care instructions.

            Great items. Ear jacket is the perfect size. A bit hard to put on first time but it's very elegant looking . The small earrings are dainty and beautiful, have enough detail despite their size. Both stay put in ears. The metal backs of the earrings were hurting me so I replaced with rubber backs. Seller shipped quickly and prices are fair. Awesome purchase!

            Same as the other earrings I ordered. I love the way they look once I get them on. They're difficult for me to put on because of the three holes on the jacket piece - it's hard to get them even. The back is extremely small and I have trouble getting it on and off. But they are really pretty once I finally get them on. I will enjoy wearing them.

            I�m not one to leave reviews, but I thought it would help the next one who falls in love online with these ear climbers. All the reviews on them are amazing. When I received them, they were beautiful and I couldn�t have been happier. The first time I wore both of them as a pair and the gem fell right into my drink in front of friends. The second time I wore just the one with m hair up, and it wasn�t until I adjusted my mirror in my car that I noticed after a few hours two gems were missing out that one too. So embarrassing. I really wanted to love these, but I would remove from cart and spend your money elsewhere.

Truly, they are the only earrings that have not infected my sensitive ears, and also very easy to insert. I've searched several handmade and other sites looking for 'the right' pair for me, and these are it! They really are one of a kind and perfect. I will be in contact soon for more requests! :-) Thank you again!!!

            Seller is very responsive and offers great advice! I requested an oxidized ""black"" finish on these ear jackets, and the seller talked me through her process and gave me tips for how to polish, lighten the black, clean/care for the earrings, and more. Very impressive and kind of her! And of course the final product came out lovely with the darker finish instead of a polished silver color, they are less flashy but in a very elegant way that stands out without being obvious, so I love it. Wonderful transaction all the way, thank you so much! I chose the DHL shipping and it was lightning fast, mostly I was shocked/happy with how quickly the seller was able to create the pieces and get them to the carrier--that is service at a high level. As such I can say, buy with confidence! You will not be disappointed.

            On the good side. They were an absolutely adorable design! Came in a great package. Very thoughtful touches! 
Sadly, even though these are titled as being precious metal, sterling/14k (which I have worn my entire life, with no issue) in the description. They immediately irritated my ears, like lesser quality metals, always have. I tried to give them a chance, but my ears ended up so irritated, they became too painful to wear. After a few more attempts, I had to throw them away, and bought a sterling silver pair from another vendor, and have not had issues. 
Great little earrings! Just make sure you don't need proper precious metal, and you will love them!!

            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)

I tried them out during my bachelorette and found them very uncomfortable, but realized it was because had tightened the little knob on top too tight. I wore them for my wedding day, from 11AM to 12AM, and let me say I didn�t even feel them (I tightened the knob the right amount that time). Everyone loved them so much! They are beyond gorgeous and so edgy. I got the pair so my mom and I could each wear one. I�ve kept on using them for outings and everyone is always complimenting me on them!

            I love this shop! Beautiful jewelry and great customer service.

The seller accidentally sent the wrong pair of earrings but was very quick to resolve. She not only reshipped the correct earrings within hours, but also let me keep the other pair for free! So now I have 2 pairs of beautiful earrings.

I live in the United States, and the earrings only took 2-3 days to arrive from Greece via DHL. This is equal to, or better than, local shipping time. The shipping time likely varies depending on where you live, but I have had positive experiences so far.

            They�re incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I�ve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don�t start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don�t tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise.

            Very delicate piece of work. I absolutely love the versatility and design of this earring! And it arrived in less than 10 days. The only thing I don�t love that much is putting it and removing it - as it has three pieces and they are quite small, it can be a blind guess to pick the correct height. But we can�t have everything, right? Otherwise, a perfect choice for a versatile person!

            I was so afraid to order this pendant because I saw another one of these at another shop that when calculated out was approximately 1/16 (pinhead size).""

I received my pendant yesterday and it is SO BEAUTIFUL, JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND THE COLOR IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. It nestles right at the hollow of my neck just above two other necklaces. They don't compete with each other and I've already received complements. Oh, and I forgot to mention the quick delivery. Laine, THANK YOU, so very much for this piece.

I cannot say enough kind things about the seller - it took a few days longer than anticipated seemingly due to customs and in the in-between time when we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail, she generously offered to send me a refund or a new order right away! I couldn't believe how generous she was to do that. Thanks for this beautiful product and incredible customer service!!

            I love this shop! Beautiful jewelry and great customer service.

The seller accidentally sent the wrong pair of earrings but was very quick to resolve. She not only reshipped the correct earrings within hours, but also let me keep the other pair for free! So now I have 2 pairs of beautiful earrings.

I live in the United States, and the earrings only took 2-3 days to arrive from Greece via DHL. This is equal to, or better than, local shipping time. The shipping time likely varies depending on where you live, but I have had positive experiences so far.

            I love these earings.  I never had a pair like this before, but figured that they would be great because i now have a baby that pulls at everything within reach.  They came in a cute box with beautiful ribon and a tiny flower attached to the ribbon.  They are made in Greece, so it took a little over a week to get here, but they are well worth the wait.

            I love this simple ear climber. It�s my first and I had no idea if I�d even like them. It�s simple, delicate, and a subtle different and exciting piece of jewelry to switch things up. Also, gold filled is the best option!

            Wow, this is my first pair of climbers and I love them!! They are so dainty and beautiful while being ever so slightly edgy. They're also very comfortable - I squeeze them tighter once on and have been able to wear them without the back and even sleep in them. 
I cannot say enough kind things about the seller - it took a few days longer than anticipated seemingly due to customs and in the in-between time when we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail, she generously offered to send me a refund or a new order right away! I couldn't believe how generous she was to do that. Thanks for this beautiful product and incredible customer service!!

            These are amazing, beautiful, fun, and vibrant earrings! The shape and colour were exact to the photos advertised. The gold hardware are a pretty touch and definitely add extra elegance to the earrings. 

The size are good, they�re a perfect size for an accent or statement. They�re also pretty light, and easy to wear ( not heavy, don�t feel agitating, simple backing ). 

The packaging was pretty, a high quality business card, simple tissue, and a cute brand sticker. 

The shipping took longer than I expected but it could have been the long processing time.

            I absolutely love these crawlers!!! I had recently received a set in a subscription box and unfortunately they were plated metal. Turned my ears green/black. I had been looking all over locally without luck for this particular style crawler and then it hit me to check Etsy! Ahhh now I am in love with your jewelry and was so impressed with these crawler that I ended up purchasing 2 other items which have come and they are absolutely perfect. Thank you so much! I certainly can foresee future purchases and have been spreading the word.

Only advice is don't bend and unbend the back too much, as it's very flexible and could break off. But that shouldn't happen if you're just wearing it normally in your ear lobe.

            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)

            It took a bit to come in, but I absolutely love these earrings. It comes with the crescent moon/horn part being detachable, so the earrings can be worn with or without them. It's basically like having two pairs of earrings! They're also very good quality - the metal doesn't bend and it has a small notch in the metal to prevent the backs from coming off on accident. Definitely worth the money I paid for these.

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays.

            From the two I ordered, this one is by far my favorite! 
My very sensitive ear is fine with this silver and it fits perfectly: for the shape of my ear, it's truly ideal. As it fits closely, it doesn't get stuck at all in my long hair. (Please, remember that each ear is unique in shape and no one has the same! ^.^) I've been wearing it all the time (even while sleeping, despite the warning of the seller who advise not to) for the last week and it's really cool. =)

I contacted the seller concerned, and they immediately sent out another package which arrived in days. I was so happy about their patience and understanding in the situation.

For the earrings, they were exactly what I expected! I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they�re beautiful. The only thing is you have to get used to putting it in your ear, especially if you�re putting it in your second hole that you rarely put earrings in. My mom prefers them in her first hole, but I think they look beautiful in a second hole with a statement earring in the first. 

They�re not expensive at all and they come with great quality and customer service!:)

            Item came quickly and is exactly as described. I have sensitive ears, so I can only wear many earrings for a matter of hours. The silver was high quality--I was able to keep it in all day with no problem. Lovely earring and very easy seller to work with!

            Beautiful pink tourmaline ring in a creative eternity ring style. The gems were as perfectly matched as possible.  The craftsmanship was perfect. The ring fit just right though I will be wearing it untraditionally, I.e. not on usual ring finger. With short fingers, as I have, the ring is more comfortable on my  first finger (next to thumb). The ring is substantial and has more weight to it than some other rings. It looks and feels great. What a wonderful job this shop did. Many thanks. Note:  communications and shipping were very prompt. Picture to follow.

            Nice earrings, as expected.  Nicely packaged, and I received them pretty fast.  They are very delicate- I bent them a little bit while I was cleaning them.  And  the backings are SO SMALL!!  They were really hard to get on the earring when they were in my ears.  I have never seen earring backings as tiny as these.  It's not a matter of the post being smaller than average, because I used earring backings from another pair, and they fit just fine.

            Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day.  Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!

            I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don�t do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don�t wear earrings very often). 

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.

However, I noted a variety of styles for various ages and fashion sense displayed in her store.

            Thank you for your feedback! I�m so sorry that the wires were too thick for you. We have since modified our wire to be slightly thinner so it can go through ear piercings a little easier, and yet still be strong enough to last. Excellent customer service is our goal, we�d be happy to resolve your problem to make sure you have positive experience with us.

            Beautiful pink tourmaline ring in a creative eternity ring style. The gems were as perfectly matched as possible.  The craftsmanship was perfect. The ring fit just right though I will be wearing it untraditionally, I.e. not on usual ring finger. With short fingers, as I have, the ring is more comfortable on my  first finger (next to thumb). The ring is substantial and has more weight to it than some other rings. It looks and feels great. What a wonderful job this shop did. Many thanks. Note:  communications and shipping were very prompt. Picture to follow.

            I thought I ordered these in turquoise due to the product description but I accidentally chose ruby! I�m not a fan of pink/ruby, so I�m sure I�d like them better in a different color. They are also larger than expected, not a great fit for delicate ears. Otherwise the quality and design is very high, the seller was not very responsive to an exchange.

            Dear customer, first of all thank you for taking the time to leave your review. I totally understand that you accidentally choose ruby instead of turquoise, but you informed me for the wrong color choice 70 days after the receipt of your earrings, which was on January 23rd, whereas I was  informed on April 2nd. 
According to my policie as well as  EU regulations, customers can  return their  orders within 14 days from day they will receive it. I hope that you understand the predicament that I was in.Thank you again for your understanding

            I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don�t do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don�t wear earrings very often). 

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.

            I bought a pair of these, loved them so much the posts broke!!! In like, 2 days. BUT Evelyn was so generous, asked that I send them back so she can see, and she made a brand-new pair free-of-charge. Each time, she included a handwritten note which made it so personal. I felt like I was just buying lovely stuff from a friend! DO buy these earrings, they're so delicate and beautiful. Just a friendly tip, though, be sure not to bend the hooks too far out so the earrings will last a little longer. I was not so graceful the first time around but will be going forward. THANK YOU, EVELYN!!

            Absolutely beautiful earring! Definitely came much quicker than the 2-3 weeks that it originally stated in the listing. I needed as a helix earring to replace a broken one I had been wearing, saw this earclimber and absolutely fell in love with the design. I wanted the earring to climb ""down"" instead of up, so I though it would be good to purchase the opposing ear (left earring for right ear). I messaged Evelyn and she was kind enough to give me many angles of the earring including measurements to make sure I felt like I was making the right decision. I definitely think I did! The earring came in a beautiful box with a nice gift bag and polishing cloth if you want to gift it.

            Dispatched quickly and arrived earlier than expected. This is truly a beautiful earring, very unusual and sits perfectly in the ear. Very comfortable to wear and the detail is gorgeous. If you are ordering from the UK be aware that you will have to pay customs charges and that will delay receipt of the item. Royal mail charge an �8 handling fee so in total add an extra �16.69 to your purchase cost. That being said it is still very worth it for this stunning ear crawler. Very happy with this wonderful earring.

            Beautiful jacket earrings. Only concern is that the lace is just glued on to the round back of the earring so I hope that it stays in tact. Really nice colour though I was expecting it to be a bit more red than purple-y but I guess it's a little open to one's own perception of colour. My shipment arrived in 10 days, so I was happy with that.

            I have been looking for earrings for my bridesmaids.  It's been hard to find something that fits my ""vision.""  I came across Rebekas page and absolutely fell in love with her designs!  I found these earring just in hopes they would work.  They took a few weeks to come in, but TOTALLY worth the wait!  Nothing was damaged, and they were packed with care.  When I opened the box that held the earrings I melted!  They look even better than the pictures!  I took them outside in the natural sunlight, and all I can say is ""WOW!""  Now that I know they are EXACTLY what I am looking for...I will be ordering 3 more for the remaining bridesmaids!  Her work is beautiful and detailed.

And they look fabulous on! They are adjustable where they clip at the top of the ear, and once you find the correct amount of pressure for your ear, they are remarkably comfy to wear.

            So pleased with this purchase!  They looked just like they were pictured.  Bonus my mother-in-law loved them.  Daffodils are her favorite flower, it was a birthday present. The earrings came in a cute soft minky fabric drawstring bag.  A hand written thank you card from the owners!  So nice!  The only downer, which isn't really a big deal, was the backers for the earrings.  I mean I don't know what I was expecting.  They were the clear plastic disk with metal in the center, if you wear earrings hopefully you know what I mean.  I feel like that type of backer seems cheap, but they're totally fine!  Like I said, I don't know what I was expecting.  So happy with this purchase.  Would definitely check out their stuff again for gifts.  Thanks so much Kellan and Keira!

            Beautiful pink tourmaline ring in a creative eternity ring style. The gems were as perfectly matched as possible.  The craftsmanship was perfect. The ring fit just right though I will be wearing it untraditionally, I.e. not on usual ring finger. With short fingers, as I have, the ring is more comfortable on my  first finger (next to thumb). The ring is substantial and has more weight to it than some other rings. It looks and feels great. What a wonderful job this shop did. Many thanks.

            I love it. I received the rose gold, water drop pendant necklace a few days ago. Great quality, the shape was the right size (not too big or not too small), and the length of the string is also adjustable (some necklaces are too long for me). I would recommend.

            Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!

            Ah beh, questo � per me! � davvero molto carino, ben fatto ed � resistente. � un oggetto particolare con colori vivaci, proprio come in foto. Ma non immaginatevi una cosa vistosa. Si fa notare con delicatezza. E di questi tempi anche i colori aiutano lo spirito! Dei venditori sono ugualmente entusiasta.

            Die Ohrringe sind toll, sehr filigran 
Es ist etwas gew�hnungsbed�rftig, sie einzusetzen

Ich hab die Ohrringe Anfang Dezember bestellt, sie kamen sp�ter als angek�ndigt (reine Versanddauer, die Versendung selbst erfolgte schneller als angegeben), was f�r mich unerheblich war und vielleicht auch mit der Vorweihnachtszeit zusammenh�ngt.
Wer aber das Paket zeitnah haben m�chte, sollte wohl Expressversand zus�tzlich buchen

            I received the pearl ear climbers  and very please with the craftsmanship. They are also known as ear pins. This pair has a modest and feminine characteristics about them which I will enjoy wearing. Not heavy on the ear lobe and the pin tread through the lobe is not to wide if you have a thick ear lobe.

            These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)

            I am very happy! I bought these because they are climbers, and I wanted to use them to hide my second lobe piercing. (The second ones was- regrettably- not done professionally and ended up leaving lopsided scarring) they hide the scars very well. And on the plus side they are inexpensive and unique! The shipping took a bit longer then I was expecting but they were worth the wait!

            I had a great experience with HarshandSweet.  The items I received were as expected and even better.  These ear climbers are absolutely adorable and the one thing I was most impressed with was that they stay in place so much better than others I've purchased.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend them.

            I was so excited to get these! As soon as my tracking app said it was delivered, I raced to the mailbox and ripped the package open! These earrings are GORGEOUS!! I love them so much and they look so good in my piercings. I want to wear these and the other earring purchase from Trium at the same time if I could haha! But I only have to piercing holes, so I�ll have to alternate. Crisan was very kind and understanding about the shipping issues, which wasn�t his fault of course, during this pandemic.

            An appreciative and big ""WOW"" is the first reaction I had when I received my first pair (but definitely not my last!) of Kathy's gorgeus creations.  They are wonderful, light weight, beautiful and well -- just fun!  Plus, as her shop descriptions explain so well, they can be worn in so many different ways so you are really getting far more than just one pair of earrings.  While the product is what you are purchasing, Kathy's caring, prompt and wonderful service is among the best of the best. Ditto the eye-catching packaging too. Thank you, Kathy, for being there and for sharing your amazing talents with all fortunate enough to cross paths with you and your great Etsy shop!

            They came and they were absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, poor lasting quality. I never got to wear them. 2 months later, without ever being worn, without ever getting wet, the silver looks like it eroded right off and theyre turning brown like what happens with really cheap material, usually over time too not just 2 months. I will never be able to wear them and it was a waste. The stars are for how just freaking pretty they were when they came.
