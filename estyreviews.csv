            Earrings thoughtfully packaged, they are just as depicted/described & they seem to be of sturdy material. I have a few items Favorited from this shop & I will possibly shop again!

            This came out wayyy better than I expected! I used these ear climbers for my wedding and they were super cute. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because I lost 1 ear climber at the end of the day. :( I know I had put it on correctly and tightened it, but it didn’t hold up. Otherwise, the earrings are still great!

            An absolutely beautiful piece of jewellery. I had to wear them as soon as they arrived! I have had multiple compliments on them and they are my new favourite pair. Blown away with the speed of delivery considering where the jewellery was coming from. 
Would definitely buy from here again!

            I absolutely LOVE my earrings! They are so unique and dainty. I’ve had so many compliments on them already and Connor wait to wear them for the wedding I’m in next week. I would recommend ordering from MilysDesign! My order was processed quickly and came wrapped safely in bubble wrap so the earrings wouldn’t get damaged.

            Oh my goodness, these earrings are absolutely gorgeous! I had to try them on as soon as I got them and I am SO happy I made this purchase! They’re the perfect size and I already know I’m going to wear them all the time. Quick shipping too!

I bought them as a gift for my mums birthday - they were delivered quickly and on time as promised!

            They came on time since they came from overseas. I love the vintage opal because it is my birthstone and it is gorgeous. the craftsmanship is unbelievable and they fit perfect without any slippage. I recommend this product to any and everyone/. The price is worth it which wasn't high at all. thank you so much for this good quality product...         sherry

            Such a beautiful set of earrings, I’ve been on the hunt for earrings which look very sophisticated and these are perfect! They fit so well and do not fall off the lobe. This is my new fav seller and I’ll definitely be buying more jewellery soon!

            I love the earrings as they are a gift for a friend.  Was shipped quickly; had an error on the mailing address.  She caught it very quickly and then changed my address.  I received them and worth a purchase.  Thank you - they are in Quebec so I am glad I could buy from a Canadian store on Etsy.

            Best jewelry ever!   I love this look.  I get sooo many compliments.  I have the ear cuffs and both ear climbers.  I did lose a climber in the shower... I think it tends to get loose and release when wet but I ordered another and am careful.   I sleep in them too no problem.   Just wonderful jewelry and awesome seller.

            Wow, these ear climbers are so beautiful in person! They're elegant and better than I expected. They're also incredibly light so you don't notice you're wearing them. You can sleep in them, shower in them, etc., and they stay securely in place. Also, the shipping was super fast. Thank you!
        "

"
            It was packaged nice and was delivered to me in a timely manner. The 925 Silver is shiny and very beautiful. However, I do think that these specific ones don't compliment my ear shape very well. They also would slide off my ear occasionally throughout my day when I would wear them. *5 stars for the fast shipping, reasonable prices, and secure packaging. Definitely looking forward to trying out some other styles of earrings and ear climbers from this shop in the future.

            I really like these earrings. It did take awhile to get them (one month) but considering they were coming from Spain during COVID and Christmas I can let that pass. Just glad to help a small business whenever I can.

            My new favorite earrings. They're incredible ans so beautiful! It was worth the wait all the way! ( I wanted to order back in March, but it was impossible)

            Shipping takes a while but that is totally normal since the product is shipping from Philippines! They were well worth the wait, I put them on immediately! So cute + dainty. Love them <3

            Climbers are so beautiful! They arrived in a cute little corked jar where they live when I'm not wearing them. The stem piece that will thread through the hole is a little thicker than most earrings, but they went in fine. Love em!
        "

"
            These are beautiful and everything I was hoping for. I wore them to my college graduation and had many compliments and people asking where I got them. They are a bit difficult to get in at first and are EXTREMELY fragile, so they are definitely not for everyday wear. If you are looking for an earring you can just put in and forget about then these are not for you. But, if you're looking for a beautiful and unique piece of jewelry to make you stand out and look Awesome, then these are it. 

I especially loved the package they were delivered in. Just magical! 
        "

"
            Absolutely love these gorgeous earrings - they are simply perfect. I chose pink and orange and the colour combination is beautiful. They are really different and I plan to order more. The packaging is also really cool! Delighted with this purchase and the seller was extremely helpful too - very happy!

            These earrings are so unusual, they look even prettier in real life. The seller was very helpful, delivery was very quick and I'll definitely be ordering more of these in different colours.

            So this is my second engagement ring, we got it to match my fiancé’s wedding band since his is grey/black with black diamonds + rose gold trim. It’s so beautiful in person and people love it! 
I put a photo of the 2 ct. salt and pepper ring with rose gold alongside my original ring (not from etsy) which is a .65 center white diamond for comparison. My ring size is a 3.5. The seller was very nice and sent me a video and photo of the diamond she would use.
        "

"
            I could not have asked for a more incredible experience or ring. Lena was so incredibly helpful and kind, and her work absolutely speaks for itself. Here’s what my (now) fiancée had to say:

“This ring is everything I’ve ever wanted. It’s perfectly petite yet makes SUCH a statement! I haven’t had it on a full 24 hours and can’t even count how many people have said ‘that is by far the most beautiful ring I’ve ever seen.’”
        "

"
            I can’t stop staring at my new engagement ring! Honestly it’s one of the prettiest rings I’ve ever seen. My fiancé is very proud of it and I’m a very happy fiancée. He says his favorite part is how much I love it. Lena was amazing and patient answering all our questions about fitting it with wedding bands we had from my grandma. She even gave us a little sneak video to help with our excitement (though to be honest it was all my excitement)!  Shipping was incredibly fast! I hear nothing but compliments when people notice my ring!
        "

"
            Words can’t even describe how impressed I was! At first I was skeptical ordering a ring without seeing it in person. However I’m so glad I did! Lena was amazing throughout the whole process! My boyfriend and I picked out this ring together as my engagement ring, but has not yet proposed, so waiting to officially wear it! Highly recommend this shop! They were very flexible with payments and doing custom sizing. Couldn’t have had a better experience!

        "

"
            I really like these! They don't irritate my ears because they are made of silver. They go with every outfit. Only issues are putting them on and taking them off is a challenge because they are very small and have 3 pieces to manage. I've dropped the pieces several times. But that's getting better with practice.

            These are so beautiful! I also like that you can wear them with or without the backing. My new favorite and everyday earrings!

            I bought this piece along with another ear jacket. I have to say, I am OBSESSED. I am really into minimalistic jewelry and I’m always looking for more jewelry that’s simple but not boring. Every time I try to find minimalist earrings I just find simple balls or gems, and I’m not a fan. These are perfect. They are simple and understated but actually an interesting design, unlike so much of what I find. Gold Spoon, keep doing you, you’re making minimalism more interesting.

            This is the 4th time I’ve purchased these earrings, and I now own them in both silver and gold. 
My first order was for myself, and as a mom and aunt of littles I wanted earrings that were lovely, go with everything, and weren’t made for little hands to pull on. I had no idea how much I would end up loving them, and they became my everyday earrings for almost two years! Sadly I knocked them out putting on my full face mask for a snorkeling trip, and lost them at the bottom of the ocean. I loved them so much I had to replace them ASAP, and they are back in my ears and still the same quality as when I originally ordered years ago. The other other two pairs I ordered as gifts for friends who really liked mine and commented on them all the time. Trust me, just order them, you’ll LOVE them, and they are flexible to adjust to your ear

            I love these!! Absolutely perfect, just what I was hoping to use on my wedding! The second clip doesn´t exacly fit my ear correctly (maybe because of my ear shape, not sure...I´ll have to figure a way), but I score 5 stars because it is absolutely stunning, shipping was on time, and packaging sooo cute (loved the details and care!). I´ll post a picture on your instagram wearing them on my big day!
        "

"
            These are beautiful, quality, and hand crafted. I love them. They are stunning and unique. Very excited for my wedding day. My only recommendation for the shop owner is to post a photo of the back of the earring. I did not realize it had a stud and a clip on section (makes sense given its design; very practical!). I also like that I can adjust the strength of the clip on part. They are a bit heavier than you might expect, so if you have sensitive ears, you might want to go a bit smaller. 
        "

            Stunning! They were the perfect touch to my wedding dress.

            Absolutely love these ear climbers! They are exactly as pictured. Took me a couple tries to get them on, as ive never worn something like this before...they were a tad tight on my ears, but a simple adjustment fixed that personal problem lol they are comfy enough to wear all day now. I also received these super fast via usps. I'll def order more from this seller in the future. Thanks!

            These are so pretty!  They're just the right amount of sparkle and I think they are very sophisticated as well as trendy.  They never fall down and are so comfortable, even when answering the phone.  I just wish they had more colors!

            I love my ear climbers! They are som comfortable and exactly what I was looking for in my second hole. I used to not be able to wear earrings in the second hole because they would get irritated from the backs. So this solved my problem because there is no ‘back’, it just slips on and stays put! I keep them in at all times, have had them a month now and haven’t taken them out once! I do live in USA and because they  originate and ship from Spain it did take almost 2 months to get them in. So just a heads up the shipping took quite a long time! But I did eventually receive item and seller was very helpful in making sure they were received.

            The item came beautifully wrapped and is as described. Shipping to Canada from Indonesia took over a month, but it was worth the wait! The X on the earring seems smaller than the photos - it is more suitable for people with smaller ears I think.

            Wonderful and responsive seller. These are easily one of my new favorite earrings (and included was a sweet midi ring, which I love!). Not only that, but shipping was super-fast and everything was carefully packaged into a sturdy little box and wrapped in felt. This is a shop that cares about the customer, and it shows. Definitely recommend!

            Die Ohrklemmen wurden sehr schnell geliefert. Sie sind kleiner als erwartet, sehen am Ohr aber perfekt aus. Das Anbringen ist für mich noch etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, da es meine ersten Ohrklemmen sind. Ich hoffe, das Material bleibt flexibel genug. Auch ein super Geschenk für Meerliebhaber - Kaufempfehlung! On top gab es noch ein Silberputztuch gratis dazu.

            These are beautiful. I love jewelry that is just a little different so these fish are great. The one gold one in with all the silver, so unique. Worth the wait (about a month) to get them from Germany

            I ordered my package January 23d and it arrived today (February 22nd), which I think is a great delivery time considering the distance and covid delays et cetera. so far I'm really happy with the quality, the packaging was great too. I can't say anything for the long run yet but I can definitely recommend shopping here!

            Package arrived in a timely fashion, item was presented well, and came with a thoughtful note from the shop. The jewelry itself is pretty, and overall I am satisfied with the purchase!

            Beautiful! A little bigger than expected but it still fits my small ears. Love them! Exactly what I wanted!
        "

            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)

            I love these earrings!!! I don't know why simulated diamonds get a bad rap. These earrings sparkle and shine like my natural ones. I'm SOLD!

            Absolutely stunning earrings and the shop is easy to deal with. It’s my second pair - different sizes - and they are my favourite every day sparkles!

            Wowee, the hype is real.  Absolutely adore these earrings, definitely my new favorites.  The oxidized look is perfect, not overdone.  Very well made.  Shipped crazy fast.  Love this shop.

            People make mistakes. How you deal with these mistakes is what makes a good shop a great shop. When I ordered these earrings for my mum, they were smaller than described. I contacted the shop and they told me they hadn't adjusted the descriptions yet so I was right. They offered to sent me a new pair in the right size free of charge and with this they went above and beyond what I expected. Turns out they aren't that much bigger after all.
I would recommend these earrings. However, it is important to keep in mind that the bars are actually a bit smaller (7 mm instead of 1 cm) than described. Also, if the space between the bottom of your earlobes and your piercing is broader than the model in de picture, the leaves of the flower won't stand out as much as they do in the pic. Other than that: nice!

"
            Fast delivery, great quality. I gave four stars because the earrings is smaller than I understood from the photo. Maybe my ears are big? Very happy with this shop, I recommend it!
        "

"
            Exactly what I was wanting for my industrial piercing. I even asked to have the earring be a bit longer and my request was granted. Exceptional work for such a minimalist piece. Thank you!!
        "

"
            Love these earrings, just wish my piercings were tighter, as even with the aid of tiny plastic backs, they have the tendency to slip out.
I personally would probably need a bigger post at the front, lovely simple earrings all the same!
Lovely, lovey seller too x

            Beautiful simple earnings, fast shipping. I will definitely buy more from this shop.

            These earrings are absolutely stunning! Quality craftsmanship and even more gorgeous in person. I am not one to leave reviews, but this earrings were totally worth the wait. I am so delighted with this purchase and this seller! I loved all the little details in the packaging too. It is obvious that the Artikats truly cares about the details from start to finish.

            Love it! Just got one side, so I can use some of my other singles on the other ear. :)
        "

"
            I love these earrings, they are so pretty! They won't stay on though, but I see that my piercing is a bit low on the earlobe so I can't really blame the earrings for that. Shipped on time, and a super sweet seller. Would definitely recommend!
        "

"
            Shipping and response time was great. 
These are by far my favourite earrings. I like that the posts are slightly shorter than typical studs – I find it more comfortable and can lay down with them in. Highly recommend! 
For those in colder areas be careful with scarves! My scarf got caught on the jacket and lost it.

            Elles sont très belles. Un peu difficile de les mettre au début mais je m'habitue. Le trou de mon oreille est un peu trop bas donc l'effet n'est pas aussi beau que sur la photo mais ce n'est pas la faute de celle qui les a fabriquer. Je vais surement recommander...Merci!!

            Délicate et parfaite c’est ma troisième commande chez le cubicule.... en plus de toutes celle à qui j’en ai parlé parcontre pour cette commande le 3 eme trous d’une des boucles est trop petit et la pine ne peut y entré. Avec mon oreille c’est celui qui me convient.On me dit que la mèche est utilisé pour tous les trous. Et on me demande de renvoyé la boucle pour agrandir le trou... je suis déçue du service après vente.

            Amazing!!! Im so in love with my new earrrings! They are trendy and unique, without being too ""out there"". I can wear them out for drinks, to my job as a nurse and to school. Perfect to wear anywhere. Very easy to put in and comfortable to wear. Ive gotten so many compliments! I love them that much- I plan on buying another set for ""backup"".
        "

"
            I loved this product. It was the perfect size and comes exactly as shown. The best part about it was the fact that can be bent slightly to adapt to different ear shapes. I straightened mine out the tiniest bit and it fits perfectly. I could not have asked for a better piece.
        "

"
            Love it!  I wear it almost everyday!  It fits perfectly in the third hole in my ear and follows the natural contour well!  Very happy.  Thanks. :)

            Favoriting the shop and on the look out for new designs. 

Not as rose gold as I thought it would be but i loooove the look of it :) 

It's pretty comfortable and so far it feels nonexistent on my ears. I have incredibly sensitive ears as well, so that's saying a lot.
        "

"
            So beautiful and easy to install. I have many old holes never used in my ears but the hole scar stay, I can hide them with that. The right stay in place but sometimes the left fall, but just put back in place and it's perfect. Fast shipping for Canada, I love it! Highly recommand it.
        "

"
            I was concerned that because ear shapes are different this would not work for me but it DOES! Beautifully crafted and fits like a dream. I have short silver hair and wanted something  that had a bit of ""bling"" but not over the top and these beautiful earrings were perfect. They were shipped timely and packaged beautifully. would recommend highly!

            These earrings are beautiful and so comfortable! I have very sensitive ears, and I love that these earrings are made from surgical steel! I can wear them all day and no problems. They also shipped very quickly. So excited to find a local British Columbian to get my jewelry from! Will be shopping here again.

Anyway. Tremendous thanks for such professionalism and talent in sharing SUCH an insanely beautiful piece. Xoxo.

"
            These earrings look just as featured -really cute and makes me look stylish and edgy! :) The packaging was really nice too- it's like you're getting a present! I took off a star bec since they're dainty, they're also kind of flimsy/thin.  If you're not careful when you take them off, they can bend and may eventually snap probably overtime.  Other than that, they're great!
        "

"
            Love them! They are now my go-to earrings when my hair is pulled back. Delivery was a little frustrating but it was clearly the fault of the shipping company and not the seller. I would absolutely buy more from her.

            They’re incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I’ve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don’t start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don’t tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they’re incredible earrings and I’m so glad I ordered them!

            This was my second purchase of these earnings as when my daughter saw them she wanted some! They arrived promptly and were beautifully wrapped in recycled material. They are much sturdier than I expected and i have not taken them out since i got my first pair about a month ago which means I have showered, slept and gone swimming with them in (probably not a good idea but I'm lazy about changing my earrings). I love them!

            I have never written a review before on anything I purchase.. Maybe I'm too lazy. Anyway. These earrings are outstanding. The quality. The color of gold. The fact that they are a little malleable so you can gently bend them to fit your ear perfectly. The shipping did take a while.. I just got them yesterday and ordered a month ago (I'm in the US) . But it was worth the wait. Thank you!

            I love this earring! My piecing is higher than the one in the listing but I think it still looks great!  I got the shortest option (4 mm) and it fits perfect!  Fast shipping too.
        "

"
            I ordered several cartilage earrings from this shop, and although they're all beautiful, this one is by far my favorite! An extremely unique and beautiful design. My only advice: After seeing them all in person (I ordered some 6mm but mostly 8mm), I do wish that I would have gotten them all in 6mm, as 8mm looks a bit too long for cartilage piercings, at least on me (an average-sized woman). I ordered the larger size as I was nervous about potential swelling from piercing, but it seems much longer than necessary in person/might bobble around. So personally, if I could go back, I'd go with all 6mm... but we'll see for sure when I finally get up the courage to do the piercings I plan on!

            Item: I love the earrings, they are great! I will say they are a little bit flimsy so be careful when putting them on!

Shipping: Great! They were shipped on time and were in tack when they arrived.

Customer Service: Very polite and helpful!

            These are so amazing! I keep getting compliments everywhere I go! I was a little nervous about the metal since I have sensitive ears but I haven’t had any issues!

            These are exactly what I was hoping for! They arrived on time, were packaged very well and look absolutely lovely in person. The shop owner was also very prompt when I had a question before I purchased. Thank you again!!

            Stunning, just stunning. Almost 20 years ago I saw my first ear climber and thought it was the prettiest thing I had ever seen.  It has taken me this long to purchase a pair. Again, I'm in love. I will definitely buy more ear climbers! Thank you for an awesome product!

            I bought these to wear for my wedding and although I decided on other earrings for my big day, I’m definitely keeping these. I love ear climber earrings and these are my new favorites! They looked so much better in person than in pictures, they’re beautiful!
        "

"
            They look absolutely beautiful!! My girlfriend loved them and when I asked the vendor for tracking as the order took maybe 13-14 days to get here she responded in less than 24 hours. Like I said shipping took awhile but it’s still 5 stars as usps is fucked right now and that’s not the vendors fault. Would definitely buy from this vendor again!

            I am obsessed!!! So cute & matches my opal wedding ring (:

            The earings are amazing :)
So airy and elegant :) These earings may turn an ordinary image to the atmospheric one :) 
Earings fit the ears very naturally.
The quality is excelent.
The delivery have arrived at time.

Thank you so much, Benitta :))))))
Your creations are admirable :))))))
Happily thanks from Istanbul :)))))

            I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my purchases! If you order, be prepared regarding the shipping. It probably could have been delivered faster via Pony Express (“shipped” on Feb 4 from NY & arrived Feb 27 in Louisiana with USPS First-Class PKG). BUT the wait was well worth it! I promise. I love the items, I’ll do it again and again!

            Beautiful! Hip and trendy, and very comfortable.  Great quality.  Absolutely my favorite ear decor!

            These are soooo cute!!! I did lose one of the cuffs pretty easy so watch out...but they look just as pictured. Awesome

            Was just what I wanted.
Very delicate.
I am receiving so many compliments!!

            Beautiful craftsmanship, they look just like the photos! I'm finding it a bit uncomfortable to put them in my ears, but I guess that probably just takes some practice (this is my first pair of ear climbers). They were carefully packaged and shipped quite fast. All in all, I would buy from this seller again. :)
        "

"
            I love my new ear climbers!  They came in a lovely little package, tied with a bow!  They are beautifully made!
        "

"
            These earrings are absolutely beautiful! Took me a bit to get them in place the first time and adjusted to my ears but now they sit comfortably and are a breeze to put in. I would highly recommend them!

            So comfortable and its perfect size!!! So pretty, too!

            These are beautiful!  The seller was amazing and happy to make custom alterations.  Wow.
        "

"
            Pictures gave excellent idea of how it would look in ear. Easy to put on and all day comfortable. Love how it looks.

            Wonderful.  I love these.  I am so glad I ordered 2 pair so I can part with one. ;)

            These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)

            Love it! It's a little bit loose and gets facing weird directions but of course it does. It's gorgeous, exactly what I wanted!

"
            Beautiful piece. Thank you so much.
        "

"
            very nice piece but too thick of a piercing neck on the earring for my cartilage hole, need to force stretch the hole to fit this piece. 
        "

"
            super cute and comfortable! they don't stay put when I try to wear them across my ear like the model (they stick out and down a little), so I just wear them vertically. I still love them, giving 4 instead of 5 stars because they didn't turn out to be what I thought they were going to... but still recommend!!!

            I'm so happy with these earrings, they are absolutely stunning!!

"
            The earrings took two weeks to arrive. It was totally okay it's understandable because I ordered it on the 22nd of December. The earrings are simple and beautiful. I definitely needed a youtube video to help me put them on. After viewing the video it takes you seconds to put them on. Totally worth the money! Must by

            Went perfectly with my gold dress! Made it in plenty of time for my event.

"
            Ordered these with the cuffs...this one fits my ear a little awkwardly, but I think it's just the shape of my ear. Loved both of these products! Show your support!

            Item arrived late but fortunately arrived safely and in perfect conditions! They're exactly as shown in the pictures, really lovely and original product (especially because it's customizable)
        "

"
            I love my new earrings ! Very original, and didn't look as big as in the picture on my ear (for the best actually). I ordered 2 pairs so it took 2 weeks production + 2 weeks shipping.
        "

"
            I'm in love with these. They arrived as expected; but since the waiting time was a bit longer I had completely forgotten about having ordered them... and then had the best surprise when opening my delivery! Thanks, they're more than perfect!
        "

"
            International shipping was right on time, the earrings are just as beautiful as pictured and feel very sturdy. This was my first experience with earring pins and I'm so impressed. Beautifully wrapped, came with a note on how to care for the earrings. Very impressed and pleased with the earrings. Looking forward to getting more earrings like these from this seller. Highly recomend!
        "

"
            It’s a bit blurry but as you can see in the picture these earrings fit perfectly! They’re beautiful and I already love them tons. No complaints- truly lovely pair of earrings.
        "

"
            Beautiful! Unfortunately, I only got to wear them once and the studs broke :(
Update: Awesome Claudia is sending me another pair ASAP! Thank you!
        "

"
            These are beautiful! They were a Christmas gift for myself. I do wish the wire fit a little tighter to my ear; because my earlobes are thin, they tend to drop instead of climb. But even then, I still love the way they look!
        "

"
            Love these! Simple but a little different and edgy. Surprisingly fast delivery even given the distance!

            These little earring chains are such an amazing, beautiful, versatile product! They turn any boring stud into a way more interesting earring and I’ve gotten many compliments! Seller is very responsive and works to make things right with customers! Will be purchasing a gold version soon!
        "

"
            I purchased a pair of yellow gold filled chains 1in length and asked for 2.5mm jump ring. They’re dainty and super cute! I wanted smaller jump rings and left a note, seller provided the perfect size!

            This earring chain and the tiny gold stud with the teardrop dangle are perfect for my daughter, dainty and beautiful. Thank you so much for them--and I also really, really appreciated the speedy delivery!

Merci beaucoup!

            I haven't worn this jewelry so I cannot yet speak for the durability and the clover is ONLY on one side. When the pendants flips (which happens often) you are left with one side with other side bare...that is why I gave a 3 star.
But this buyer has great customer service. The product was well packed with contact to me to ensure and notify me of when my product will be arriving.
I enjoy a good product but more, I enjoy a great customer service experience.
Thanks!

            Article très sympa, au début un peu de mal pour les accrocher mais on s'habitue vite. Je les ai reçue aussitôt (période de Noël) avec en prime un gentil mot de la personne et un p'tit cadeau, vraiment cool!

            These are literally so beautiful. I don't spend very much money on jewelry in general because I tend to lose it, but these just felt so special. They look great and feel great. I can't say enough good things.

            I love this set.  It is very small but exactly what I wanted.  Thanks!!
        "

"
            These are super cute, fit nicely, are easy to use, and got lots of compliments! The packing was safe, and the shipping was very fast. When I had a question about the item, the store owner replied very promptly. Be advised that the two ""jacket"" sections are textured on the same side (not mirror-images of each other), so when you flip one to wear it, they are slightly different. Also, the earrings I received look more like gold cylinders (about 3mm high) rather than the dimpled, button-like ones in the photo. This was totally fine for me, and I am very happy with my purchase, but if you have questions about the set, just ask the seller! She's very friendly and quick to get back with you. Overall, I love this set and feel pretty wearing it. :)

"
            Love these! First time trying this style and I’m addicted. These are simple and elegant.
        "

"
            These are so fun!! They are definitely big which means they don't pair easily with other large earrings, but if you're buying them to be the statement piece (which is what I did), then they are perfection! Definitely my current favorite earrings! And easy to use with a mask!
        "

"
            These are now my new favorite earrings! They’re made out of good quality materials but they don’t feel heavy when I put them on! Definitely will come back to get more from your shop!!!

"
            The earrings are beautiful and unique - I get so many questions and compliments about them, I am definitely purchasing from AIRlab again.
        "

"
            Delicate and beautifully hand made, these were shipped quickly and securely! Maybe it is just my curved earlobes, but the triangle ear jackets weigh next to nothing so they may not hang straight downwards. Your ears may differ. Thank-you for the earrings.  
        "

"
            These are my new favorite pair of earrings! They seriously go with everything. They were packaged securely and arrived in as timely a manner as I could have hoped, given that they came from another continent. I don't buy much jewelry, but I can definitely see myself buying more pieces from airlab!
        "

"
            I'm in love with these earrings! When I first looked at them I thought that they were too small and wouldn't be noticeable but they hold they're own! Definitely buying again from this seller

            I absolutely LOVE my ear jacket earrings; they are so delicate and beautiful, as well as versatile as you can wear them 3 different ways. 
They came in lovely packaging, but I wont tell what it is and spoil the surprise. :) 
        "

"
            Love these! Thank you for the upgrade to a better material! I will probably be a repeat customer in the near future :)
        "

"
            The x is much smaller than the picture suggests. It’s maybe the size of a pencil eraser. It’s kind of hard to see. Maybe these models just have tiny faces and ears, but i was expecting the earrings to be larger.
        "

"
            I love these earrings!  They're super versatile and can be worn dressy or casual. I also love that I can just wear the main bar only if I want, so it's like getting two pairs in one.
        "

"
            These are so nice on.  First time wearing ear jackets and they were a bit fiddly to get on but practice makes it easier.  Really understated, modern look.  Love them!

            Such cute earrings! I ordered silver, however when I received them they were gold with purple pinwheels. However I just bought some paint from Ben Franklin and painted the pinwheels blue and the sticks silver, to match my wedding colors. 
n
nThe pinwheels actually spin - SO CUTE! Love these earrings.

nAlso fast shipping. Great work! :)

"
            Absolutely love those earnings!!!! I was looking for something unique and I found it. They are nicely made and come in adorable packaging that can also be storage box for them. I love the fact that you can rotate tiny wind mills like you would in real life :) Overall fast delivery. Top notch. I recommend the seller.
        "

"
            I love how the colour looks like in the product picture so I just choose the same colour ""Multicolor"". Now I quote the seller's words when he replied my question about ""Multicolor"": ""When I make a pair of pinwheel earrings in multicolor the color shades are blue - violet - gold at the bottom of the windmill and gold - teal on the top."" So the real products don't really have the same look as in the picture, but they are still beautiful, with ombre effect ;)
        "

"
            I am absolutely in love with these! They're exactly as I imagined. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
        "

"
            I love these!! I got them to replace some my husband had purchased for me from another site that just didn't fit my small ears. But these are the  perfect size and great quality.
        "

"
            My ear climbers are elegant and a bit sassy. I get lots of compliments. The short climbers are a perfect size for my small ears and are very comfortable to wear. I love them!
The international delivery and correspondence was very quick. I'm already trying to work out my next Glamrocks Designs purchase - thank you!

            Absolutely gorgeous. The pictures don't do them justice, they're awesome! The presentation was also adorable and flawless; if you're considering them as a gift, get them!!

            These earrings are gorgeous and so much lighter than I thought they would be. I have very sensitive ears, and these have caused me no issues.  They are also so gorgeous and I can't stop looking at them. Amazing purchase!
        "

"
            Absolutely ADORE these earrings! Have gotten tones of compliments on them already. They are super cute and very lightweight; I wore them all day and forgot they were there. Definitely recommend.
        "

"
            These are amazing, beautiful, fun, and vibrant earrings! The shape and colour were exact to the photos advertised. The gold hardware are a pretty touch and definitely add extra elegance to the earrings. 

The size are good, they’re a perfect size for an accent or statement. They’re also pretty light, and easy to wear ( not heavy, don’t feel agitating, simple backing ). 

The packaging was pretty, a high quality business card, simple tissue, and a cute brand sticker. 

The shipping took longer than I expected but it could have been the long processing time. 

Overall they’re gorgeous and I would definitely buy from this boutique again!

            So beautiful! I love a beautiful mess and these collabs are awesome!

"
            I wear these in my first love. They are beautiful and fall in exactly the right place. I bought a total of three sets of earrings from this seller (all pictured in my lobes). These are the perfect combination of sparkle and opal. I’ve showered in them and worked out in them but they have no turned green. The backs fit securely and I never feel at risk of losing the earrings. I love these so much. I’ll definitely purchase more from this seller.
        "

"
            Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I’ve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they’re always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I’ll probably buy from the seller again.
        "

            These are so dainty and sophisticated! They match my other earrings perfectly. I'm glad I shopped with Sami. Quick USPS delivery too! I got gold hoops from her shop too (pictured), they look lovely together :)

            These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I put them in my fourth holes to wrap up into my cartilage, and I love them! I also purchased two other pairs of the clusters of three (in photo), and they are really pretty! I would highly recommend!

            The moonstone is more a bright white stone. It’s super pretty but doesn’t have the flashes of blue I’m used to with moonstone. That said, it’s super pretty

            These are even more beautiful in person. I got two pairs. One yellow gold (left) and one white gold (right). Both hammered. The hammered effect makes the light hit them at different angles and gives them a little sparkle. They can be dressed up or down. The shop owner is amazing and communication is fantastic! Highly recommend!

            I wore these beautiful earrings for my wedding and they were perfect. She made sure I had them in time and I received  so many compliments.  I love that I will definitely wear them over and over too. Can be dressed up or dressed down!

            I had not considered a pair of ear climbers before spotting these... something about the shape in the photo just spoke to me, and they are every bit as beautiful in reality. I have a fairly neutral skin tone but tend to wear silver. I bought these in the hammered gold because I reckoned this would give a softer glow of gold, which it does (and it was an occasion for spoiling myself). They feel superb in the hand and look gorgeous on. More of a subtle and elegant touch than a statement piece, I know I am going to get loads of use from them. They shipped much faster than promised too.

            Really LOVE it! Sits perfectly, very light and elegant, fits to any look and highlights the ear beautifully. Delivery was quick and painless, everything is perfect. 

Thank you, Claire, I will be back:)

            These have been my favorite purchase on Etsy so far! They are absolutely stunning and I get compliments all the time when I wear them. They look to be very high quality, not cheaply made. You will not be disappointed!

            These earrings were exactly what I imagined when I ordered minimalist gold climbers. Very comfortable and beautiful. Quickly became my favorite earrings for my sensitive ears!! Highly recommend.
        "

            I'm having a bit of trouble getting these to really grip my ear but I think I just need to get some pliers and squeeze them a little.  Other than that, very pretty, very comfortable and very good value for real gold.

            I LOVE these ear jackets!  As soon as they arrived, I switched out what I was wearing for these, and I've barely taken them off since!  They are very well made, and I just love the look.  I measured my ears to ensure these would fit (well, I had a helper).  They sometimes fit a little longer than pictured, but if I push the bottom against my ear, they look as pictured.  Either way is great - don't hesitate!  Virginia, thanks for making these for me!
        "

"
            Beautiful handmade earrings. My earlobes are kind of small so the ball spheres hang down a little lower than shown in the picture, but they are really cool anyway. The seller kept in touch with me about shipping when the wait was a little longer than expected. Thanks!
        "

"
            I have always hated jacket earrings...until I saw these!!!  So cute, such simple design, clever, and modern.  I love them!!
        "

"
            I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!

            I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

I absolutely love them and can't wait to show it off.  Requesting material upgrade was not a hassle since I love my 18K!  I don't have a picture to post because I'm saving it for my birthday.

            I wish I could give 10 stars because my custom made smiley face ring came out beautiful.  I ordered my ring on July 21, 2020 and received it today July 30, 2020.  What an awesome job done I mean the craftsmanship is speechless.  Looking forward to doing business with this company again all the way from California.  Thanks a million Diri Jewels.

        "

"
            I love these moon phase ear climbers! They are a fabulous statement piece and very lightweight to wear. So many of the ear climbers on Etsy have a very exaggerated curve that doesn't actually follow the shape of your ear, but these look great when you have them in.

Trop contente ! il correspond totalement à mes attentes, j'ai commandé le 8mm avec finition argenté, je ne quitte plus le collier, je dors avec et fait du sport avec, je le garde même sous la douche et il tient très bien.

Je vais le commander de nouveau en 6mm, pour le prix autant se faire plaisir.

            BEAUTIFUL earrings! I love these earrings so much! I wore them in my wedding and received so many compliments.  The sparkles were gorgeous. I technically didn't wear them as intended with the climbing style because I realized that personally I have pretty small ears and when I put them on as so the earrings kind of flared out. So I switched sides with the earrings and allowed them to hang down. They were beyond expectations and SO beautiful. I would highly recommend these earrings and shop to anyone looking for the perfect amount of sparkle and beauty!
        "

            I wore these as MOH at my friend's wedding. Absolutely loved them!
        "

"
            Absolutely stunning earings!!! My only complaint: while the clamp style backing on the top of the earing is great for keeping it in place, it is slightly uncomfortable. That said, I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely buy from this seller again.

            The earrings are really lovely! Looks exactly like on the pic even more beautifully!. I am really happy that I chose them. Thank you ! :)

"
            I LOVE these ear pins.  They are very unique, and I got several compliments the very first time I wore them.  Emmanuela is SO good at communication, she even was able to tell me a package had been lost before I realized it.  She shipped a new pair immediately and it arrived (in Florida) from Greece in just 3 days.  I would definitely recommend this seller (and artist!) without reservation.  I've just never experienced such prompt communication in probably a hundred transactions!

            I love these earrings. I was alittle nervous at first because I have very sensitive ears but I didnt have an allergic reaction at all. I always get complimented on them. They cute dressed up or down. I use them as my everyday simple jewelry.

            These earrings are even more gorgeous in person! They are comfortable to wear (I've never worn earrings like this before, so I wasn't sure!)! Any time I wear them, I get compliments! Thank you!!!

            I absolutely LOVE this item! I've been looking for a more fun item for my cartilage piercing and j have finally found it. Great material. Very awesome artist too- I goofed and ordered the left earring when I needed the right, and she was so open to the exchange and it was super easy. Thanks Melanie!! 
        "

            I love it!...might want to pierce the left just to wear another one of these. Just a suggestion, maybe a shorter post with a smoother/screw clasp...but still love what I got!

"
            Beautiful earring, very well made. I had to send back to get the post moved down to sit better in my ear. Melanie was more than happy to fix my earring. She was fast with applying to message and fast shipping. I will definitely be ordering more jewelry from her

            Amazing packaging, very creative and eco friendly.  These jackets are great for wearing with any studs, haven't tried them slipped onto climbers yet but I can see them being amazing for that as well.  Very tempted to get the longer pair as well.

            I've wanted to try an ear climber for a while, but wasn't really sure how they would look on me.  I decided on this gorgeous design and I'm so glad I did.  I love them (I ordered the pair).  They are fantastic...don't hesitate if you're thinking about these!

            Sehr schöne und massive Ohrstecker. Das minimalistische Design ist toll und ich wurde schon ein paar mal auf diese Ohrringe angesprochen. 
Die Stecker sind gut und sauber gearbeitet, ein wenig umständlich anzuziehen (erst das Querstück, dann hinter dem Ohrläppchen das senkrechte Teil und dann den ""Stopfen""). Es sind keine Ohrringe, die man mal über Nacht anlassen kann, da sie schon recht massiv sind. 
 
Alles in allem finde ich sie sehr schön und kann sie nur weiter empfehlen. Sie kamen in einer sehr schönen Verpackung mit einem persönlichen Gruß der Verkäuferin an. Der Versand war auch okay, dafür dass sie aus Griechenland kamen!

            Beautiful delicate earing that look great. The reason for not giving 5 stars is that they are a little difficult to get in; I personally would have preferred a straight stud connection.
        "

"
            Absolutely love the cuffs! They are the perfect size. They stay on my ear. I have worn them overnight and they are still on in the morning! 
The earrings are a different story. They look exactly like the picture but they are so long. They actually slide right off my ear and just dangle which looks terrible. I would recommend getting the shorter ones. But they are very dainty and seem well made. Very happy.
        "

"
            Had searched all over to find just the perfect ear climber, and this is it!  That the ear cuffs were included was a bonus, and really set off the climber perfectly.
        "

"
            This set of earring is the best. I love them! They fit perfectly and also the gold coating is a strong one (I recently made a bad experience where I also bought earrings, but the coating came of after 4 days of wearing them!) Its always risky to purchase things over the internet, but not with this seller. I put all my trust in her and I am going to purchase even more from her. Highly recommended =)

            Albina makes such beautiful pieces- I absolutely love my ear cuffs and ear climber. She was so kind in her customer service as I needed to exchange sizes and she was so helpful and quick in shipping the right sizes out and letting me do so! I will definitely be ordering more pieces from her in the future. If I could give her a 100 star rating I would! Just lovely all around!

"
            These are lovely! I wasn’t sure how they would look since most of the pictures were of the climbers in the lower lobe / first piercing hole and I planned on wearing them up higher. (Plus my second piercing spot there is really, really old so it’s lower than I’d like now) but they still work and look beautiful. It’s nice having something a little different! Nice color and great quality, too.

            This is the second pair of ear crawlers I bought from VermeilSupplies, and I was not disappointed! My favorite thing about these crawlers is that they stay in place perfectly - not too tight, and I don't find myself having to inch them back into place throughout the day.
        "

"
            Not only are these really pretty and cute...but they are also the most comfortable ear climbers I have worn!! In love!
        "

"
            I debated whether to dock a star on this because I ran into a hassle actually getting them, but once they arrived I decided to give 5 stars because these earrings are really great! They are an ingenious design and exactly what I wanted. I needed earrings to wear sleeping/ to keep my holes open that would be comfortable and not fall out. They fit very securely and look great! Also, the seller puts them in a little bottle for presentation- so cool, and I can use the tiny bottle for something else. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase even though I ran into a snafu with actually getting them.
        "

"
            I really liked my earrings. They're a bit bigger on me than on the model, but I do have small ears. They also arrived a bit on the late side, but I did order them during the holidays, and the shop owner was very attentive about the situation, so I'm still giving a five star review. Very pretty! And sturdy!

            I LOVE THESE! I go them way before I expected them! I was worried about them not fitting but they fit perfectly! They are well made and exactly what i was hoping for! I also loved the vial that it came in, it was a very nice touch!

            Loooooooove this product!! Shipping was so fast and they came in perfect condition! They look exactly like the picture as well :D 

Update: it's been two days and the earring jacket completely broke.
        "

"
            Customer contacted us after the item broke. The ear jacket was defective, but we placed a new on in the mail the next business day. We will always replace any defective product, and take precautions for that same mistake not to happen in the future.

            I LOVE these earrings! I have the hammered silver ones. They can be dressed up or down, always get compliments on them! Love them so much that when I lost one traveling, I bought the pair immediately again!

            Thank you so much for these beautiful earrings. I love them!! Just what i hoped for and clearly made with such care.
        "

            I can not express how much I love these earrings. I misplaced one around Christmas, and instead of doing an intense search I just went a ordered another pair. The seller is so nice and included something extra in the package and I really really appreciated that. I will be buying more from this shop in the future:)

            Leider habe ich einen Ohrkletterer gleich beim ersten Mal tragen verloren; hat schlicht nicht gut gehalten. Schade, denn ich finde sie sehr schön - den zweiten trage ich jetzt solo, aber nur unter größter Vorsicht...denn auch ihn hatte ich bereits verloren aber wiedergefunden. Und nachdem ich das bisher Geschriebene gepostet hatte,hat mich Shani kontaktiert u sofort angeboten mir nochmals Ohrkletterer zukommen zu lassen. Das ist unglaublich nett! und es liegt an meinen Ohren nicht am coolen Ohrschmuck! danke...

            Updated -
Shani reached out to me after seeing my review and has been great in ensuring that I get a climber that works with my ear type. She is creating a pair based on my actual ear type. I""ve sent off photos and cannot wait to get them so I can wear them everyday! Thank you, Shani!

Original Post July 30
""These seemed like the perfect climber in pictures.  In reality, they are much more curved than on the model and don't 'climb' but rather arch on my lobe. I am a bit disappointed as I have held out for so long on this type of earring.  However, even though they are not the style I was expecting, they are of good quality and still hope to wear them.""
        "

            Thank you so much for the earrings. Those looks amazing. I am wearing them everyday, they are comfy and the colour is very nice. I have to mention that, they get a lot of compliments not only from my friends, but even from strangers. Also they shipped quicker than I thought. 
Thank you so much!

            I love these so much! My ears a pretty sensitive, and there is no irritation, and they are so cute!

            Love these! They are the perfect size to be noticeable, but not heavy at all. Arrived when expected, even with the postal delays in the States.

            So very happy with my order! This chain ear jacket is everything I've been wanting, and after searching around I'm so glad I came across this one. You cannot beat the price, and I'm in love with how it looks!
        "

            Ear cuff is gorgeous. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the size was for the longer rather than shorter chain. I won't be able to use for what I had initially purchased for, but will have to find another use for it in the future. Kat was very accommodating. Thank you!
        "

"
            I got this chain to attach to my conch piercing - would recommend getting the smallest size if you’re planning to do the same as any larger will look oddly droopy. Easy to put on and comfortable on my ear, a good alternative to a hoop

            I wore this at my wedding a couple of weeks ago. This bracelet matched the dress perfectly and I got many compliments from friends and family. I’m so happy I ordered it.

            These earrings are BEAUTIFUL! They are even better than the pictures - great quality, wore them all day with no trouble. 

The shipping took a minute, but that is solely due to international shipping and COVID-19 impacts around the world. Dimitra was responsive to my questions and lovely to chat with. 

Thank you so so much! I love these earrings and can't wait to buy more!

            First off, the seller shipped these so fast! It was great how quickly I received them. I ordered two pairs, silver for myself and gold for my sister. They are flexible enough to slightly open to get on and close to stay in place. They look great!

            These earrings are so cool. Fit snug on your earlobe. Easy to put on. So cute!! Got lots of compliments. Shipped fast too.

        "

"
            love these earrings. They are climbers, but they aren't obnoxiously climbers, so if you're looking for something that is similiar, but not all the way up your earlobe, these are the ones. The titanium is great for my daughter who has a nickel allergy. We have the silver matte finish, and I am thinking about orderring a pair for myself, or maybe stealing my daughter's pair. ships from Greece, so it does take a minute getting here, but they are beautifully wrapped. Went in easter basket.

            It's beautiful, comfortable, stays in place, and exactly as pictured! It also is one of the few earrings I can wear that doesn't irritate my sensitive ears.  I love it and have gotten so many compliments on it already.  Thank you Kristen!

            Great little earrings! I was nervous because I wanted to wear these in my third holes but they are small enough that they look great even that far up my earlobe without going into the part where my ear curls over. Comfy enough to sleep in (though I usually turn them face down) which is what I wanted and it was really hard to find a climber earring that didn't have a stud back. The back also is adjustable for how tight it is which is nice and no irritation from wearing them for a long time. Highly recommend!

            These earrings are amazing! I didn't want anything too big just simple and dainty and these earrings are exactly that! So happy with my purchase and so happy with the quality. Thanks again!

            I asked for flat gold discs instead of the little ball studs and was accomodated! These are high quality- you can feel it in the weight of the product. They look super cool and are what I envisioned and wanted in an ear jacket set. I really appreciate the ability to set how low or high you want the jacket to be. It's bound to be as snug or as low as you want it! Thank you so so much!!
        "

            These are awesome! I love them! Very very light and comfortable. I can wear my headphones at work without the post hurting me. Lots of compliments on them too! These look WAY better than my picture shows.

            I LOVE these earrings! Oak leaves and acorns are my family’s thing (because of the saying “Mighty oaks from little acorns grow.”) so these earrings are very special to me. They are well made and beautiful! I’d buy the other earring set available too if the two earrings were mirror images of each other. Also, if there were a bar style necklace with a chain soldered to each side of this curved oak branch, I’d buy it too. I definitely recommend these earrings!
        "

            I ordered these as a Thank You grift for my oldest sister/ Bridesmaid. She is incredibly picky but when I showed her these she LOVED them. They are delicate and beautiful in person.  Each item is handmade and comes in an adorable package as well! Shipping was also super easy and fast!

"
            So stunning. I love it!!!

*Just noting that in the picture I’m wearing it on the wrong ear, it’s supposed to be on the other so that the earring curves down (with the shape of the earlobe) and not up.

            Super fast shipping! for reference my earlobes are ~0.25in and the earrings are a little too big for my lobes. I still like them but it's not the same effect of the picture

            I love these! I've always had issues with small earrings looking like they've disappeared in my ear lobe because of the shape, but these don't! They're super simple for everyday wear, but you can also use them for something a little fancier!

I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!

            I am in love with these earrings. They also have an adjustable post (on the dangling piece) to accommodate short or long earlobes - so thoughtful! I also received a small gift in addition to the order. These are handmade pieces, so expect some time for your delivery, but it was worth the wait! <3

            These earring are absolutely PERFECT , I’ve had other climbers that constantly fall off the ear but these stay right where you put them- so beautiful and exactly what I was expecting!

            I love this so much the hood was a little to big it was my misordering so I ordered another one in the correct hood size that I need because I have this so much
        "

"
            I’ve been buying from here for the past few months since I’ve been able to switch up my jewelry. Very high quality, does not cause any tightness or discomfort. 

One thing I will say though, when I get the gold, it does fade a little over time into silver. It doesn’t take away from the quality of the piercing I’m assuming it’s because I still clean my piercing often. 

The titanium and silver for sure are the absolute best!

The gems are beautiful and I love the eccentric designs they have.

            I am just in love with this piece , I chose to put it in my daith and it's so flattering and fills the space perfectly .  I love the uniqueness of it !
        "

"
            Beautiful earrings. The climbers have a long back piece that is more narrow at the base than at the top. I think it is designed this way to help secure them in place but my lobe is slightly big for the narrow part. It doesn't cause much of an issue just every so often they pop out of place a bit. They took a bit of adjusting to see how they fit best on my lobe. Otherwise they look and feel great! I have been admiring these for a while so I was happy to finally take the plunge and be satisfied with my purchase :-)
        "

"
            Love these earrings! I did have to use little stoppers on the ends bc I didn’t feel them secure enough, but they’re so beautiful!!

Thank you!

"
            I love these earrings so much they have been the only earrings I have worn in the past 2+ years. They dont bother me when sleeping, which was my main reason for buying, and always look great. The only reason I’ve had to buy earrings since I first got a pair from here is because I have had them occasionally fall out and get lost- so I just replace them (love that I can buy one at a time)! All styles of the climber earrings at this shop get five stars from me.  Shipping is fast and the packaging is lovely. Can’t recommend enough.

I will definitely buy from this seller again.

            Slightly bigger than I expected but very nice. I thought the lower silver ball would sit closer to my ear lobe. A different earring from the usual studs I wear, so something new and special for my collection. Thank you :)

Worth every penny!

"
            Loved these! They are just as beautiful and sparkly in person. Wore them for my wedding day and plan to wear them for many more weddings/events I attend. The only issue was the size of the holes in the ear jacket itself. The earring posts only fit in some (not all) of the holes, so I couldn't wear them on the lower setting I wanted to (since only one side fit through). I wore them on a higher setting so the ear jacket sat lower. They still looked great, just not quite the look I was going for.

            This came out wayyy better than I expected! I used these ear climbers for my wedding and they were super cute. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars is because I lost 1 ear climber at the end of the day. :( I know I had put it on correctly and tightened it, but it didn’t hold up. Otherwise, the earrings are still great!

            An absolutely beautiful piece of jewellery. I had to wear them as soon as they arrived! I have had multiple compliments on them and they are my new favourite pair. Blown away with the speed of delivery considering where the jewellery was coming from. 
Would definitely buy from here again!

            These are gorgeous earrings! They fit me really well even though I have small ears. They are the perfect accessory for any event.

            I’m over the moon happy with my new gold chain! I bought the 20” wheat chain and was worried it would be too thin or not long enough, but it’s exactly what I wanted! It stacks beautifully with my other gold necklaces and I can’t wait to hang a gold pendant on it for some more eye-catching depth.

            I wanted a small pair of hoops I can wear everyday & not take out. I contemplated getting the 10mm, but so glad I got the 12mm, they’re perfect!!! I ordered them early Monday morning & got them the next day!!!
        "

"
            This shipped so quickly! I ordered the day before Christmas and told the seller I was not in a rush and I knew shipping would be crazy. I was not expecting my orders to get here for awhile. I’m seriously impressed with them! The item is as described and I love the earrings. I will definitely order from them again.

            Purchased the 14k yellow gold 1mm diamond cut Singapore necklace chain. This is the second time I have bought from this seller, and I couldn’t be more pleased. This chain is gorgeous and high quality. The twisted design makes it sparkle. It’s delicate without feeling flimsy. The perfect thickness, and no worries it will break. I put a pendant on it about the size of a quarter, and it looks great.

            I was so pleasantly surprised when I received these because they were more detailed and beautiful in person than what I saw on the picture. Unfortunately for me they didn’t fit my ears right, I have small ears so I’m not surprised, and when it reached out to the seller to ask for a return the customer service was phenomenal and the process was super easy. Even though this pair of earrings didn’t work out for me I will be looking for another pair through this seller

            Absolutely adorable!! These earrings immediately caught my eye and I just had to buy them. They are so cute, and the packaging was amazing. It comes with a little sticker and with a cute case for the earrings. The backings were silicone and super comfy on my ears. I can’t get enough of the floral design and the color. Really great quality and I can’t wait to wear them more often once COVID is over!!!

            The cuffs arrived in a timely fashion.  They are small and petite.  I have a short haircut.  I really like the way they look on my ear.  They do not draw a lot of attention.  That is the kind of person I am.  The plus is I don't have to have a lot of ear piercings to dress things up.

            I love these earrings! They are cute, a little bit different and I get lots of compliments on them.  The bonus is that they cover up a stretched-out piercing.  I might have to get them in another color!

            The simple design and perfect size make these studs so versatile. I got both the Tiger eye and Obsidian and love both equally!

            I ordered two different versions of these earrings as gifts for friends and love them both. The tiger eye ones are especially cool -- THANK you for the personal touch in communicating about the different stones, and thanks for what you do.

            These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists.

(I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)

            I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!

            These ear cuffs are beautiful and elegant! Very well made!  They look very nice on the ear.  Very comfortable to wear.  Shipping was very quick.

            I really wanted a set of black and white diamond earrings to match my wedding set, but wanted to be able to wear just the studs every day, so these stud jackets were perfect!  Very sturdy, and sparkly, not cheap looking or fragile at all. Super fast shipping too, they arrived before Christmas and I honestly didn’t expect to get them before the new year!

            5 stars because that's the only way it would let me upload a picture..

Unfortunately I am disappointed with the purchase of these earrings. I bought the necklace pictured from the same Etsy store and I'm absolutely in love with it. I bought the earrings because I thought they would compliment the necklace nicely. As much as the style of the earrings matches the stock photos, the color and sparkle just isn't there :( They barely sparkle at all and look very dark and bland in comparison. They are made well though. I'm just sad that I spent a good chunk of money on them for no sparkle
        "

"
            It is beautiful! Made well!  Compliments my engagement ring perfectly.
        "

"
            When I ordered the ring, the listing said it would take a few weeks to arrive, but we received it in 8 days! I had to wait almost 2 weeks before Etsy would leave a review, that's how fast it shipped.

The ring itself is perfect, it's very light compared to a lot of modern men's rings and the comfort fit edge is very smooth. It's a little small but that's my fault for not accommodating my fiance's knuckles. We're going to take it to a local jeweler to be sized because that issue is not Pompeii's fault. 

Definitely recommend using these guys if you're looking for a men's ring.

            After purchasing ear crawlers with my constellation, I thought it was very fitting to get another set with my stone. These are very well made, they feel safe, and they look as pretty on as it is shown in the photo. Delivery was excellent, as scheduled. Many thanks.

            My favorite. These earrings look so cool in your ear. They fit really comfortably. Probably the most comfortable ear crawlers I own. They are very well made and I love the design.

            I just got a third piercing in my lobe and was looking for something small that wouldn't stand out too much when I wasn't wearing earrings in the lower piercings. These are perfect! They're even smaller than I imagined, but absolutely lovely. I'm so glad I discovered this shop - great quality products, beautiful design, adorable packaging, and quick delivery! I will definitely be ordering again in the future!

            These necklaces are top quality! I bought these for my 2 sisters and they love it. The quality is great (18K gold) and so is the length (17 inches). The length is identical to the one with the female wearing it in the thumbnail.

            Very pleased with my beautiful purchase, as are my kids seeing it when I wear the birthstone necklace with their names. I was able to VERY EASILY correspond with Caitlyn to be able to order exactly what I wanted, even when I made an addition to the design. 
It got lost in the mail. I can’t be more impressed with how easy & efficient communication was to solve this problem.

            Earrings look well made in person and were nicely wrapped for the holiday! Made it easy for my husband :) There are three holes on the jackets so you can customize based on the shape of your lobe or how much “dangle” you want!

            Lovely earrings! The back piece has two stacked holes for attachment so that you can adjust how much of the earring is visible from the front. The package also included two types of earring backers: metal and silicone (I think).

            When I accidentally broke my first necklace, I had to order another one from Hagitbar.  This is my favorite necklace and my go to for most of my outfits. The chain is delicate, the length is long, and the design adds to any outfit. It especially looks good with navy blue... Hagit makes beautiful pieces!
        "

"
            I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

I absolutely love them and can't wait to show it off.  Requesting material upgrade was not a hassle since I love my 18K!  I don't have a picture to post because I'm saving it for my birthday.

            I wish I could give 10 stars because my custom made smiley face ring came out beautiful.  I ordered my ring on July 21, 2020 and received it today July 30, 2020.  What an awesome job done I mean the craftsmanship is speechless.  Looking forward to doing business with this company again all the way from California.  Thanks a million Diri Jewels.

            I received the Silver ball ear jacket earrings.  They are very well made and sturdy.  The posts were fine, not too thick.  And something else noteworthy is that the back part where the balls hang is adjustable.  So if you're piercing hole is closer to the bottom of your ear lobe, you can adjust the back part so it doesn't hang too low.  Beautiful!!

            Initially awkward to put on, but now I have got the hang of it (I had to refer to the pics). Nevertheless, this was the most accurate Cancer Zodiac Constellation earrings that I found (6 stars, rather than 5). 10/10 for the tracked DHL courier delivery to the UK.

            Well, it took some time to get here from Sweden (I think), but I knew that up front.  The earrings are great, adorably packaged in little cork-topped glass bottles.  Well worth the price!  Happy purchase, thanks!

            The earring is beautiful. I love the design and color. One thing which really surprised me was actually how light weight this earring is and how small. It really feels like you’re just wearing studs which is great.

"
            I don't know why I waited so long to purchase these. Seriously, they are the cutest little dainty ear jackets! Love the little spirals and curls, they are charming. Plus the phenomenal packaging - they come in a great little box, with anti tarnish strip, and the earrings are clipped onto a tree slice, words don't do it justice but it's fancy and perfect if you're wanting to gift these to someone very lucky! Photo doesn't do the box justice. I am pleased (very pleased!) with this purchase and highly recommend the seller.

            This earrings couldn't be anymore awesome. They came nicely placed in a little wooden slice, with a piece of polishing cloth and an anti-tarnish paper.

            Very cute and pretty comfy! It doesn't feel heavy on my ear. Shipped really fast! My only issue is that it slides a bit on my ear when I adjust my hair, but I think that's more the fault of my small ear than the earring.

            I have ruined my ears with gauges in the past, the holes are small but still too big for regular earrings these work so perfectly, they are so beautiful in person and well made!! So perfect for my wedding day. Came very quickly, my only criticism is the packaging. Could be more nicely packaged it up. But the earrings themselves were not damaged or anything at all.

            It’s hard to put it in your ears, but once they are in, they are beautiful and just like on the pictures! Though it kinda irritates my ears

            wore it once and its perfect. The only thing is that my ears are thin so it doesn't to stay up. They look great down as well. I would tighten it but the instructions says not to.

        "

"
            Envoi très rapide, très jolies boucles d'oreilles qui font leur petit effet... Par contre, je ne comprends pas pourquoi à la pointe de la boucle, il y a un petit anneau, comme s'il manquait quelque chose?
Serait-ce en fait une moitié de boucle d'oreille ?

            Stunning earrings! Absolutely love them. Very thoughtful to include instructions on how to put them in, as that first time is a bit like a puzzle. Fast delivery to. Would definitely recommend.

            Absolutely gorgeous and so delicate and light catching! (I am referring to the silver triangle ear climbers).  My new favorite jewelry shop on Etsy! So lovely and very high quality.

            Triangle ear climber- what a great buy! I'm allergic to earrings so I have to be careful about the material, but these are as they are described which is huge! They are beautiful. Pricey- but the first earring that I can wear full time and I get so many compliments! I would suggest wearing one of these and buying the single triangle earing. It makes it an expensive buy... Wish they would make it a package deal!!
        "

"
            I am obsessed: these are dainty but also different and quirky. I have gotten so many compliments on them!

            Absolutely awesome. True to colour and looks in the photos. Love them!

            I love these earrings. well made and a good size, not too big to overtake everything but not so small that they go unnoticed. Great on-trend colour that's good for autumn winter. I will be going back to this shop to purchase some more earrings

            I got these earrings for my wedding day. I tried them out during my bachelorette and found them very uncomfortable, but realized it was because had tightened the little knob on top too tight. I wore them for my wedding day, from 11AM to 12AM, and let me say I didn’t even feel them (I tightened the knob the right amount that time). Everyone loved them so much! They are beyond gorgeous and so edgy. I got the pair so my mom and I could each wear one. I’ve kept on using them for outings and everyone is always complimenting me on them! Arrived within a couple of weeks, which is a plus! Love them!

            I love everything lavender, so these were prefect! I just had a baby recently and she is now grabbing at things...she won't be able to pull these!
Arrived in a timely manner considering Covid and the fact that they came from across the world. V
The attention to detail is awesome, I got them in the rustic silver. I'll update with a picture later. I am a happy client!
        "

"
            Since these are made to order, be prepared to be patient. They are well worth it! They look even better in person and are so comfortable I forget I’m wearing them! I feel like I have a bit of nature preserved and adorning my ears. Don’t hesitate to buy from this shop!

            Ah beh, questo è per me! È davvero molto carino, ben fatto ed è resistente. È un oggetto particolare con colori vivaci, proprio come in foto. Ma non immaginatevi una cosa vistosa. Si fa notare con delicatezza. E di questi tempi anche i colori aiutano lo spirito! Dei venditori sono ugualmente entusiasta.

            Slightly smaller than photo and hole was too small for my diamond screwbacks.  Seller was very helpful though and made hole larger, but it still didn't fit, so I purchased morganite studs to pair with them instead.  It is beautiful and I get lots of compliments.

            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)

            I love these earrings!!! I don't know why simulated diamonds get a bad rap. These earrings sparkle and shine like my natural ones. I'm SOLD!

            They are sooo pretty and sparkling and exceeded my expectations. Haven’t worn them yet but they look solid so I’m hoping they will hold up. They were bubble wrapped individually so they were secure during shipping. 
I got 1 gold pair and 5 silver pairs for my bridesmaids and 1 silver pair for me so we can all match for the wedding!!

            There are not enough words to express my appreciation for this seller's beautiful creations and more importantly the caring, attention and genuine kindness that comes with each item they sell.  You will likely be thrilled with whatever you get from this shop, but if there are any issues at all, you can rest assured they will work very hard to help find the best and most prompt solutions for their customers.  These folks care and we need LOTS more of that in today's world!

            Love love love. Really compliments my engagement ring!! I wanted a band that didn't hide under my engagement ring and it's perfect. It's very dainty and I can see myself wearing it by itself if I wanted to and it still being beautiful. Also the hand written note and beautiful ring box were so sweet.

            I am getting married in a couple months and was looking for a unique wedding band when i stumbled upon this jeweler. their pictures were gorgeous and i knew i had to order my ring from them. I was a little nervous ordering online instead of in person at a jeweler but i am so glad i did! the sweet seller was so kind and detail oriented she wanted to make sure it was perfectly fitted for my exact engagement ring and that the style was exactly what i wanted. My fiancé and I are both so obsessed with how it turned out and I can’t wait to wear it! thank you so much for creating my dream ring!!

            I really like the concept of jacket earrings and these r cute but much much smaller than they appear in picture. I'm keeping them. I dont think it's the sellers fault; couldn't get a good feel for size in pic. They are cute and I will wear them and buy more from this seller.

            Wonderful. Great quality, have not had any adverse reactions to the product. Very easy to put in and the perfect size. Large enough to see but not where its overbearing on my ear. I really love the look of the hammered silver texture on the front of the earring. 

Very easy to lose heads up!

            J'ai acheté ces boucles d'oreille pour une amie qui en est ravie, elle les porte très régulièrement.

            Super cute and super dainty! I’m always afraid it’s going to break though because it does get bendy very easily. Also! This was by far the fastest shipping I have received from an Etsy shop! Thank you!!

            Cutest ever!! and perfect size, excited to wear everyday!

            I got these to put in my ""bridesmaid"" proposal boxes for my celestial themed wedding, and they're so cute!!
        "

            So cute. Can be worn as an accent piece on either ear, maybe with an ear cuff to contrast. Worn on both ears, it's cute too! Feels sturdy, and can be secured by positioning the climber to desired spot then squeezing both sides closed. I thought it might be too big for my small ears andI'm glad I took the risk cause it paid off. Love the fact it's adjustable! Love the packaging too (tiny test tube securely wrapped in bubble wrap) and the silver-care instructions.

            Love these earrings and get lots of comments about them! 
Production and shipping were as specified, and it was great to be able to track them online once shipped.  They were a little fiddly at the start, but once I got used to them i have no problem now putting them in and taking them out. Definitely recommend them!!

            I love it. I received the rose gold, water drop pendant necklace a few days ago. Great quality, the shape was the right size (not too big or not too small), and the length of the string is also adjustable (some necklaces are too long for me). I would recommend.

            I bought the tiny gold knot earrings and they're so cute! I love them a lot! The shipping was also very fast!

            Very cute and everyday wear ring. I love the little pearl! I like how the ring is one size so it can fit any of my fingers. This is a nice present to give to anyone! The design of the package is cute too. My orders came well protected and on time.

            Great items. Ear jacket is the perfect size. A bit hard to put on first time but it's very elegant looking . The small earrings are dainty and beautiful, have enough detail despite their size. Both stay put in ears. The metal backs of the earrings were hurting me so I replaced with rubber backs. Seller shipped quickly and prices are fair. Awesome purchase!
        "

"
            Same as the other earrings I ordered. I love the way they look once I get them on. They're difficult for me to put on because of the three holes on the jacket piece - it's hard to get them even. The back is extremely small and I have trouble getting it on and off. But they are really pretty once I finally get them on. I will enjoy wearing them.
        "

            Second pair. Love this shop! My 1st pair was the black in this style and now I have the gold. So so so many compliments on these at work! Thank you
        "

"
            These are great! I love the adjustable backing. Turns out my ears are different sizes, so they need to be on different holes but they still look even.

            I’m not one to leave reviews, but I thought it would help the next one who falls in love online with these ear climbers. All the reviews on them are amazing. When I received them, they were beautiful and I couldn’t have been happier. The first time I wore both of them as a pair and the gem fell right into my drink in front of friends. The second time I wore just the one with m hair up, and it wasn’t until I adjusted my mirror in my car that I noticed after a few hours two gems were missing out that one too. So embarrassing. I really wanted to love these, but I would remove from cart and spend your money elsewhere.

            Wow, Lalia!!!!!! Wow! Thank you so much for honoring my request and shipping so quickly. The quality and beauty of these earrings are incredible. Truly, they are the only earrings that have not infected my sensitive ears, and also very easy to insert. I've searched several handmade and other sites looking for 'the right' pair for me, and these are it! They really are one of a kind and perfect. I will be in contact soon for more requests! :-) Thank you again!!!

            Seller is very responsive and offers great advice! I requested an oxidized ""black"" finish on these ear jackets, and the seller talked me through her process and gave me tips for how to polish, lighten the black, clean/care for the earrings, and more. Very impressive and kind of her! And of course the final product came out lovely with the darker finish instead of a polished silver color, they are less flashy but in a very elegant way that stands out without being obvious, so I love it. Wonderful transaction all the way, thank you so much! I chose the DHL shipping and it was lightning fast, mostly I was shocked/happy with how quickly the seller was able to create the pieces and get them to the carrier--that is service at a high level. As such I can say, buy with confidence! You will not be disappointed.

            Love my climber earrings in both gold and silver!  Delicate, but the hammered effects really refract and throw the light beautifully!
Fast shipping, too.  Thank you.  Highly recommended.

            On the good side. They were an absolutely adorable design! Came in a great package. Very thoughtful touches! 
Sadly, even though these are titled as being precious metal, sterling/14k (which I have worn my entire life, with no issue) in the description. They immediately irritated my ears, like lesser quality metals, always have. I tried to give them a chance, but my ears ended up so irritated, they became too painful to wear. After a few more attempts, I had to throw them away, and bought a sterling silver pair from another vendor, and have not had issues. 
Great little earrings! Just make sure you don't need proper precious metal, and you will love them!!

            I have super sensitive ears/skin. I haven’t been able to wear jewelry for years. I can wear these without issue. I’m so happy!!

            My favorite part about these earrings is how easy they are to just slide on! And I’m never worried about losing one because they really stay put, even without a back. Plus they look AWESOME!
        "

"
            These earring look just as pictured, they are good quality and they arrived on time. My only slight critique, is that they fit a little tight. But I think I can adjust that myself easily! So all in all good!
        "

"
            These don't hurt my ears at all! I have SUPER sensitive skin - and almost every pair of earrings I own start to irritate my skin within about an hour. These don't at all! 

They even come labeled for which one is for which ear, which trust me, I needed! ;) 

Thanks for creating amazing earrings. I'm a customer for life!

            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)

            I love these earrings!!! I don't know why simulated diamonds get a bad rap. These earrings sparkle and shine like my natural ones. I'm SOLD!

            I bought these for 9 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves them! She loves how they look like she has a second piercing and how they twinkle on her ears. I’m a huge fan as well, absolutely adorable on her :) this is her first pair of ear climbers and now not her last. Well made and exactly as described.
Thank you!

            WOW! I love it! This is the first ear climber I've ever had and I was worried about the fit- This came in and I popped it on so easily. It feels very secure without pinching me and I can't even tell I'm wearing it. I also got the dark pearls with gold drips and am equally impressed with those. The seller was very forthcoming about how the shipping ended up being delayed due to world events, and I never felt worried about it.

            This earring is so cool! I love it. The quality and craftspersonship is wonderful. They packaged it with great care for shipping. Included a cleaning cloth and how to care card. The jewelry box it came in is lovely, unique looking and perfect size for storage to keep it safe from being bent. I will definitely order from Mariejune again.

            They are sooo pretty and sparkling and exceeded my expectations. Haven’t worn them yet but they look solid so I’m hoping they will hold up. They were bubble wrapped individually so they were secure during shipping. 
I got 1 gold pair and 5 silver pairs for my bridesmaids and 1 silver pair for me so we can all match for the wedding!!

            I got these earrings for my wedding day. I tried them out during my bachelorette and found them very uncomfortable, but realized it was because had tightened the little knob on top too tight. I wore them for my wedding day, from 11AM to 12AM, and let me say I didn’t even feel them (I tightened the knob the right amount that time). Everyone loved them so much! They are beyond gorgeous and so edgy. I got the pair so my mom and I could each wear one. I’ve kept on using them for outings and everyone is always complimenting me on them! Arrived within a couple of weeks, which is a plus! Love them!
        "

"
            The seller was very prompt at shipping. Let me tell you the ear cuffs are gorgeous and I would definitely recommend this shop for anyone. I was very skeptical as to how a simple lobe clip will hold entire cuffs weight onto ear. I had lot of problems keeping ear cuffs in position. These cuffs are light in weight and clip on lobe holds everything in place. Love it
        "

"
            Absolutely stunning, I'm obsessed!! It was worth every penny. I love the screw mechanism that holds the crawler on my ear, I usually have issues with ear crawlers staying put but that's not at all an issue with these. I will definitely be buying from this shop again.
        "

            Lovely earrings. I can't wait to gift these to my bridesmaids. 
        "

"
            I ADORE the white topaz ear pins! I bought a pair instead of just the one. I wore them out to dinner last night and I was stopped by several people and asked about them. I have my ears pierced 15 times, so ear cuffs and crawlers dont really work for me. I will definitely be ordering some more similar items from this shop. Beautiful!
        "

"
            Love it even though it's a bit big but that's because I have super small ears. Love this edgie sweet ellegent adornment. Will buy more. Thanx

            I love ear cuffs and bling, haha. This ear cuff fits perfectly and it’s a great size for my ear, it’s very comfortable. I like that you can buy only one side because I like wearing mine on the left and I always feel like the right earring goes to waste when I buy them so major plus!! Looking out for you to make them in yellow gold!! Thank you!!

            I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

            I wish I could give 10 stars because my custom made smiley face ring came out beautiful.  I ordered my ring on July 21, 2020 and received it today July 30, 2020.  What an awesome job done I mean the craftsmanship is speechless.  Looking forward to doing business with this company again all the way from California.  Thanks a million Diri Jewels.

            I wanted something to cover my stretched earlobe and this earclimber does exactly this. It looks very sweet and feminine

            I love it. I received the rose gold, water drop pendant necklace a few days ago. Great quality, the shape was the right size (not too big or not too small), and the length of the string is also adjustable (some necklaces are too long for me). I would recommend.

            Very cute and everyday wear ring. I love the little pearl! I like how the ring is one size so it can fit any of my fingers. This is a nice present to give to anyone! The design of the package is cute too. My orders came well protected and on time.

            These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)

            The earrings are nice but if you have thick lobes like mine it won't look as good as in the pictures.

            Beautiful earrings! Even better than on picture! Thank you
        "

            I love this shop! Beautiful jewelry and great customer service.

The seller accidentally sent the wrong pair of earrings but was very quick to resolve. She not only reshipped the correct earrings within hours, but also let me keep the other pair for free! So now I have 2 pairs of beautiful earrings.

I live in the United States, and the earrings only took 2-3 days to arrive from Greece via DHL. This is equal to, or better than, local shipping time. The shipping time likely varies depending on where you live, but I have had positive experiences so far.

"
            They’re incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I’ve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don’t start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don’t tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they’re incredible earrings and I’m so glad I ordered them!
        "

"
            These are earrings I wear every day, clean once in a while and put back in. They are perfect for me! I have several ear holes and these go in the bottom. It took a long time for them to get to me... but worth the wait! Love them. Exactly as pictured. Great shop!

            J'ai ces boucles en or et en argent et je les adore ! Je les mets avec des perles ou les barres pour des looks différents ?
        "

"
            Very delicate piece of work. I absolutely love the versatility and design of this earring! And it arrived in less than 10 days. The only thing I don’t love that much is putting it and removing it - as it has three pieces and they are quite small, it can be a blind guess to pick the correct height. But we can’t have everything, right? Otherwise, a perfect choice for a versatile person!

            Completely obsessed with these earrings. I got a pair for me (just got a black kitten) and a pair for my mother in law who owns a Siamese. The “white” kitty earrings are more Siamese looking to me so they are perfect and I know she will love them. The handwritten card was so cute and thoughtful as well. The baggies the earrings came with are also adorable and make for a great gift. Thank you Kellan & Keira!

            I have come to admire this very different style of earring.  Quite stunning in person. I purchased to coordinate with the equally gorgeous Sapphire Blue bracelet in this order.  High quality creation.

"
            These took quite awhile to arrive - 17 days - but they are here now and I love them. For my smaller earlobes they are perfect - stud earrings in only one piece and the curved end doesn't show at all. I'll wear them often. Thank you!

            Nice! I like how I can sleep with it because It doesn't hurt! It's also very minimalistic which I like.. No need for clip ons.

            I love these earrings! I will say that shipping was exceptionally slow, with no tracking info shared, and the seller could have been more responsive. That said, the product was worth it!!

**EDIT, these have become my favorite jewelry I’ve ever owned and have held up extremely well with being slept in and worn constantly. So worth it!!!

"
            I am in love with these earrings. They also have an adjustable post (on the dangling piece) to accommodate short or long earlobes - so thoughtful! I also received a small gift in addition to the order. These are handmade pieces, so expect some time for your delivery, but it was worth the wait! <3

            I love them so much ! I’ve owned a lot of climber style earrings. Some of the backings are really flimsy or too far apart to be able to squeeze them together to fit your ear. These ones are perfect !!!

My only critique is that they are very small

            These are great! They are very similar to another pair I ordered from sweetiepips, but I couldn't decide!  I am happy that they were priced affordably... I didn't have to choose, I just bought both!  I love the unique look of the jacket versus the traditional dangle. And the gold and yellow colors of this season are filling my closet!

            I was so afraid to order this pendant because I saw another one of these at another shop that when calculated out was approximately 1/16 (pinhead size).""  I was looking for a small pendant with turquoise but not that small. I found LaineBenthallDesigns and thought I'd give it a try. I received my pendant yesterday and it is SO BEAUTIFUL, JUST THE RIGHT SIZE AND THE COLOR IS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING. It nestles right at the hollow of my neck just above two other necklaces. They don't compete with each other and I've already received complements. Oh, and I forgot to mention the quick delivery. Laine, THANK YOU, so very much for this piece. The only time I will remove it is to clean it!

            USPS is a little bit slow getting it to me, but it showed up today! And it's just what I was hoping for. Fits on my 16"" chain due to generous bale. Love the sweet sparkling topaz.

"
            These ear climbers are simply stunning! They can accessorize both casual and formal outfits, adding an elegant edge. Shipping was very quick (much quicker than I expected). 

I also purchased ear cuffs from this shop. They look delicate, but are well-made and again lend some fun and edge to any outfit.
        "

"
            I love this simple ear climber. It’s my first and I had no idea if I’d even like them. It’s simple, delicate, and a subtle different and exciting piece of jewelry to switch things up. Also, gold filled is the best option!

And, the small details when I received my package was such a pleasant surprise. This is why I love shopping local!
        "

"
            Wow, this is my first pair of climbers and I love them!! They are so dainty and beautiful while being ever so slightly edgy. They're also very comfortable - I squeeze them tighter once on and have been able to wear them without the back and even sleep in them. 
I cannot say enough kind things about the seller - it took a few days longer than anticipated seemingly due to customs and in the in-between time when we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail, she generously offered to send me a refund or a new order right away! I couldn't believe how generous she was to do that. Thanks for this beautiful product and incredible customer service!!

            I love this shop! Beautiful jewelry and great customer service.

The seller accidentally sent the wrong pair of earrings but was very quick to resolve. She not only reshipped the correct earrings within hours, but also let me keep the other pair for free! So now I have 2 pairs of beautiful earrings.

I live in the United States, and the earrings only took 2-3 days to arrive from Greece via DHL. This is equal to, or better than, local shipping time. The shipping time likely varies depending on where you live, but I have had positive experiences so far.

            I love these earings.  I never had a pair like this before, but figured that they would be great because i now have a baby that pulls at everything within reach.  They came in a cute box with beautiful ribon and a tiny flower attached to the ribbon.  They are made in Greece, so it took a little over a week to get here, but they are well worth the wait.

            I had never bought earrings like these before and was unfamiliar with how to get them in my ear.  The owner was really nice about sending me a YouTube video explaining it. Which I should have thought to look up, but it didn't occur to me. Thank you. They're great.

            I love this simple ear climber. It’s my first and I had no idea if I’d even like them. It’s simple, delicate, and a subtle different and exciting piece of jewelry to switch things up. Also, gold filled is the best option!

And, the small details when I received my package was such a pleasant surprise. This is why I love shopping local!
        "

"
            Wow, this is my first pair of climbers and I love them!! They are so dainty and beautiful while being ever so slightly edgy. They're also very comfortable - I squeeze them tighter once on and have been able to wear them without the back and even sleep in them. 
I cannot say enough kind things about the seller - it took a few days longer than anticipated seemingly due to customs and in the in-between time when we thought they might have gotten lost in the mail, she generously offered to send me a refund or a new order right away! I couldn't believe how generous she was to do that. Thanks for this beautiful product and incredible customer service!!

            I was so excited to receive this & finally did. Packaging is cute enough & they write that they are excited and expecting to read a positive review online w/a very thick marker that isn't the easiest to read. I love the look of these earrings but they won't stay put/stay in place in one ear so will be returning.

            My husband bought me these earrings for my birthday. I absolutely love them and always get complimented on them when I wear them. Unfortunately whilst getting ready for a 10k run, the back flew off and I lost one earjacket in the middle of a field. I contacted Kat and she made me a new ear jacket to match my remaining one. Such brilliant service and delivered quickly. Thank you Kat. I will definitely be purchasing more items in the future.

            So beautiful! I was impressed when I opened the lovely box to see those 2 very delicate ear climbers. I was afraid it would be too big or not delicate enough when I ordered it, it's not. It's just perfect, beautifully made.
The shipping was very fast and carefully made. Charlie was very nice. I will definitly follow this shop and look up for new items soon.

            Beautiful delicate earing that look great. The reason for not giving 5 stars is that they are a little difficult to get in; I personally would have preferred a straight stud connection.

            I was so pleasantly surprised when I received these because they were more detailed and beautiful in person than what I saw on the picture. Unfortunately for me they didn’t fit my ears right, I have small ears so I’m not surprised, and when it reached out to the seller to ask for a return the customer service was phenomenal and the process was super easy. Even though this pair of earrings didn’t work out for me I will be looking for another pair through this seller

            Exactly what I was looking for. Danielle was very communicative on the status, making sure that the pieces were perfect before delivery. Artisanship, quality and a truly beautiful design. (*I bought the phoenix earrings, necklace and swan ring. I feel the same for all three, so this review will be across all!!)

            Love this! Hard to put on the first time, as back needs to be adjusted to width of ear, but easy from then onwards. Earrings stay in place as per sales photo. And they get great compliments.

            I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

I absolutely love them and can't wait to show it off.  Requesting material upgrade was not a hassle since I love my 18K!  I don't have a picture to post because I'm saving it for my birthday.

            I wish I could give 10 stars because my custom made smiley face ring came out beautiful.  I ordered my ring on July 21, 2020 and received it today July 30, 2020.  What an awesome job done I mean the craftsmanship is speechless.  Looking forward to doing business with this company again all the way from California.  Thanks a million Diri Jewels.

            Great product! I love these! Amy made these slightly less curved for me, since my ear is straighter and I was placing them in the 2nd whole up my ear. I had to bend them slightly to be a little straighter. They fit perfectly in the groove of my ear and stay put very well!

            These are amazing, beautiful, fun, and vibrant earrings! The shape and colour were exact to the photos advertised. The gold hardware are a pretty touch and definitely add extra elegance to the earrings. 

The size are good, they’re a perfect size for an accent or statement. They’re also pretty light, and easy to wear ( not heavy, don’t feel agitating, simple backing ). 

The packaging was pretty, a high quality business card, simple tissue, and a cute brand sticker. 

The shipping took longer than I expected but it could have been the long processing time. 

Overall they’re gorgeous and I would definitely buy from this boutique again!

            I absolutely love these crawlers!!! I had recently received a set in a subscription box and unfortunately they were plated metal. Turned my ears green/black. I had been looking all over locally without luck for this particular style crawler and then it hit me to check Etsy! Ahhh now I am in love with your jewelry and was so impressed with these crawler that I ended up purchasing 2 other items which have come and they are absolutely perfect. Thank you so much! I certainly can foresee future purchases and have been spreading the word. 
Thanks again,

            Wow super fast shipping! I ordered these ear pins on a Thursday & got them the following Monday. I like how these ear pins don't look ""crafty"" like most of the listings for ear pins do. These pins look like high quality store sold earrings. Will definitely purchase from this shop again.

            I am so pleased with the quality of the jewelry I purchased. The geometric earrings are stunning and extremely unique. The communication with ArtiKats was fast and professional. I look forward to purchasing from this seller again!

            Gorgeous and as pictured. Arrived speedily via air mail (under two weeks from Greece to Westchester, NY). Seller extremely communicative.
        "

            I love them! They're so pretty and elegant.  I will definitely order in the future from ArtiKats.
Also, the shop owner is very kind, because I ordered 2 pairs in 2 separate orders and she refunded me one of the shipping costs.

            Just lovely! Really satisfied with this purchase, bought them as a birthday gift for my mum. The design is quite unique and they are very well crafted. Packaging was well thought out in its simplicity and so was the handwritten note which gave the gift a personal touch. Arrived sooner than expected. Would definitely come back to this shop!

            I really like the ear pin! Thank you! It brings out my heritage.

            Loved it! Classy and beautiful!

            My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead-  instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.
        "

"
            It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that’s to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!

            Very happy with my order! The earings are lovely and very good quality. The necklaces are very pretty too, I really love them though I find the chains a little short (especially for the moon necklace which seemed longer on the pictures).
        "

"
            I love these earrings- they are exactly like the photo. With just a gentle pinch, they stay in place, comfortably, all day. Super happy with this seller and jewelry!

            Love love love these earrings! Beautifully made good quality. I wear mine as a climber and it looks great.
        "

"
            They’re incredible quality and absolutely gorgeous. I’ve only had them for a month, and they are by far my most worn earrings. I love them! They don’t start to leave any kind of green marks on my ears like a lot of other silver jewelry- they just look amazing :) They don’t tangle at all, which I expected them to so that was a great surprise. Overall, they’re incredible earrings and I’m so glad I ordered them!
        "

"
            Love it! Minimal, modern climber that will be my go-to accessory. Came in cute packaging and fast deliver.

            Delivered quickly and the ear climbers are of excellent quality. I've gotten so many compliments! I will definitely be buying from ViaFrancesca in the future.

            I only ordered one earring, not sure why I did that because now I want a pair! Love the shape! I wear them all day, I don’t even take them off at night when I sleep...

            Also, die Ohrringe sind super. Klein, unaufgeregt und doch sehr besonders und schön.

            The ring was shipped fast and it's beautiful! I did Size up as they suggested. My engagement ring is a thinner band and 5.25. They suggested a size 6 for this 6mm wide band and it fits perfect!
        "

"
            I've had the pineapple version of this necklace in gold and have been wearing it 24/7 for months (including in the shower) and it still looks perfect. So I knew these would be perfect gifts for my bridesmaids - I bought them all different charms that reminded me of them and I can't wait to give them away. They come packaged in a really cute little box too!
        "

"
            I ordered these in gold a few years ago and they have been a wardrobe staple ever since. My mother-in-law had been complementing them so I ordered her a set in silver and she absolutely loves them!
        "

"
            The earings are amazing :)
So airy and elegant :) These earings may turn an ordinary image to the atmospheric one :) 
Earings fit the ears very naturally.
The quality is excelent.
The delivery have arrived at time.

Thank you so much, Benitta :))))))
Your creations are admirable :))))))
Happily thanks from Istanbul :)))))

            I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE my purchases! If you order, be prepared regarding the shipping. It probably could have been delivered faster via Pony Express (“shipped” on Feb 4 from NY & arrived Feb 27 in Louisiana with USPS First-Class PKG). BUT the wait was well worth it! I promise. I love the items, I’ll do it again and again!
        "

"
            Beautiful! Hip and trendy, and very comfortable.  Great quality.  Absolutely my favorite ear decor!

            These are soooo cute!!! I did lose one of the cuffs pretty easy so watch out...but they look just as pictured. Awesome
        "

"
            So here it goes - the wait was excruciating. It took forever but boy was it worth it! They are beautiful. I am truly in love with them and as greedy as my nature is I will be coming back for more! There is still lapis and sweet turquoises to be had! 
        "

"
            I'd be glad  to review it if it were not still away across the country in Montreal, according to the tracking report.  It's been stuck there a long  time, so I hope somebody can get the package moving again.

The package has arrived, and I'm delighted.  It's especially useful to have the included little jar to keep the silver safe from tarnish.  Thanks!
        "

"
            I loved the packaging! The only reason why I didn’t give five stars was that the stones weren’t as brilliant as the picture depicted. After I shined the ear climbers throughly it looked a lot better. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase!
        "

"
            I love this idea, it's a very pretty look. 
Thank you!!

            These earrings are lovely, and great for the price! I love rose gold and these are so delicate. They shipped to me quickly and I had them in my hands a few days after ordering. Only advice is don't bend and unbend the back too much, as it's very flexible and could break off. But that shouldn't happen if you're just wearing it normally in your ear lobe.
        "

"
            I looooove this product. The earrings are beautiful and so dainty!!

        "

"
            The rose gold color is beautiful and it is very eye-catching and unique. The right earring was a little tight but I think I can bend it a bit and it will be fine. Love that it's comfortable enough to sleep in and doesn't irritate at all. Thanks again!
        "

"
            Magnifique!
        "

"
            Love these earrings, they look amazing and I've got loads of compliments on them. They're really comfortable to wear due to their being hypoallergenic titanium and you can adjust the tightness of the wires at the back which is useful. I wear these all the time
        "

"
            Had these earrings for a few months now, and I am in love with them!!!  I get compliments constantly.  I have an issue wearing any other metal in my ears other than titanium, and I can't find pretty titanium earrings anywhere else.  These are perfect!  I have them in 24/7 and have no issues.  Will definitely be purchasing more!

"
            WOW! I love it! This is the first ear climber I've ever had and I was worried about the fit- This came in and I popped it on so easily. It feels very secure without pinching me and I can't even tell I'm wearing it. I also got the dark pearls with gold drips and am equally impressed with those. The seller was very forthcoming about how the shipping ended up being delayed due to world events, and I never felt worried about it.

            This earring is so cool! I love it. The quality and craftspersonship is wonderful. They packaged it with great care for shipping. Included a cleaning cloth and how to care card. The jewelry box it came in is lovely, unique looking and perfect size for storage to keep it safe from being bent. I will definitely order from Mariejune again.

            A beautiful and really unusual pair of ear climbers in black diamond. They’re so delicate it’s clear to see the skill that went into making them. Bought for my sister’s 30th birthday and she loves them. Would definitely buy again.

        "

            Beautiful, delicate looking, yet well made. When I wore it the first time, even my husband noticed and thought they were beautiful. Customer service was stellar (my questions regarding the earrings were answered promptly, the earrings were dispatched on time).  My personal style trend towards a more classic look.  However, I noted a variety of styles for various ages and fashion sense displayed in her store. So I bought a few more pieces as Christmas gifts for my mom in law, sister and daughters and snuck another earring climber in for myself!

            It took about a month for this to get from Israel -> US, but that’s to be expected with customs and covid. But my ear climber is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! Great quality and just gorgeous. I will definitely be buying from this jewelry artist again!

"
            My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead-  instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.

            Absolutely gorgeous earrings! They glisten like nothing I’ve ever seen. The backs are pretty small, so I’ve had to order larger backs to keep the earrings from drooping, but that’s a small price to pay. My new favorite earrings!
        "

"
            I have 7 piercings, however, I haven't worn earrings in a while because I lost 2 pairs of diamond earrings that my husband had gifted me a few years ago. They were studs with screw backs, however, the screw backs would loosen! Needless to say, that's how I lost my earrings. I decided to go ahead and purchase these earrings because I didn't want my holes to close up. The earrings are incredibly beautiful! I'll be honest and say that I have PTSD, so I constantly check on my earrings. However, I'm glad to say that they've been secured tightly and intact so far! I definitely see myself making future purchases for my loved ones (or for myself!)
        "

"
            I asked the seller if they would be willing to make a custom pair of earrings to match a pair that I had lost. The seller went above and beyond and they turned out nearly identical. I am so so happy!! I would highly recommend this shop. Thank you for a wonderful experience and the beautiful pair of earrings!
        "

            I love the look of these but they are super thin and bend really easily.

            These are pretty but very fragile. I don't think I will have them long. The wire bends as you put them in your ears. But... They are very pretty!

            I had ordered this gorgeous item for my father’s wedding. It paired beautifully with my red mermaid dress. I didn’t even need anything else because this earring made a bold statement!

            One of the most cutest things!! Love it! I can recommend to the others.

            Wow are these gorgeous! I’m a minimalist and picky about what goes into my closet. I’ve searched for a few years and finally found the perfect piece. They’re light, well-crafted, extremely stylish. Very happy customer!

            These earrings are GORGEOUS and so sparkly. I ordered the rose gold color and got so many compliments on my wedding day. Everyone loved them and I am so happy they are trendy enough to rewear.

            It took a bit to come in, but I absolutely love these earrings. It comes with the crescent moon/horn part being detachable, so the earrings can be worn with or without them. It's basically like having two pairs of earrings! They're also very good quality - the metal doesn't bend and it has a small notch in the metal to prevent the backs from coming off on accident. Definitely worth the money I paid for these.

            I LOVE these earrings!!  They are so unique!  This is my first time wearing earrings with a jacket and I really like the way they look.  They aren't too heavy and I like the contrast of the stone with the metal.  I have already ordered another piece from this shop!  The seller is very nice to work with as well!

            Absolutely adore these erings!

            These are gorgeous and I'm very pleased with them.  Some earrings have a shape that doesn't lend itself to being easily interpreted, which I was a bit worried about before receiving these, but now that I've got them in, they are clearly butterflies from every angle, and I love how dainty and clean-lined they are.

            I love these earrings.  I always worry about wearing heavy dangling earrings because I don't want my earlobes to get stretched out, but studs don't always cut it for a classy outfit.  These are perfect, they are super light and elegant.

            I loved my earrings! They were a perfect match to my dress and got many compliments! They were also very unique and I was pleased with the order and even happier they came from Israel, my homeland. Thank you Dana for such beautiful jewelry! She was also very quick to answer and super responsive. Highly recommend!
        "

"
            I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don’t do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don’t wear earrings very often). 

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.

            These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!
        "

            The loveliest shop owner! Dana was so kind and helpful! We managed to surprise a bride to be with these stunning earrings for her wedding day! Highly recommend and would shop again! x

            I love it. I received the rose gold, water drop pendant necklace a few days ago. Great quality, the shape was the right size (not too big or not too small), and the length of the string is also adjustable (some necklaces are too long for me). I would recommend.

            I bought the tiny gold knot earrings and they're so cute! I love them a lot! The shipping was also very fast!

            Very cute and everyday wear ring. I love the little pearl! I like how the ring is one size so it can fit any of my fingers. This is a nice present to give to anyone! The design of the package is cute too. My orders came well protected and on time.

            I love the earrings! They are beautiful and unique. The only issue I had was waiting for the product to get delivered - it took over four weeks from the time it was shipped before it was delivered. Sometimes that is just unavoidable though. Definitely still recommend the earrings!
        "

"
            The earrings are so delicate and beautiful and the little bottle that came with them was so cute! Couldn't love them more. Thanks so much! 
        "

"
            From the two I ordered, this one is by far my favorite! 
My very sensitive ear is fine with this silver and it fits perfectly: for the shape of my ear, it's truly ideal. As it fits closely, it doesn't get stuck at all in my long hair. (Please, remember that each ear is unique in shape and no one has the same! ^.^) I've been wearing it all the time (even while sleeping, despite the warning of the seller who advise not to) for the last week and it's really cool. =)  
        "

"
            They are so beautiful, thank you!  I love the little glass jar they came in too.  Very cute and creative :)  Thank you!
        "

"
            My experience with this seller was amazing! I have never had a package lost in the mail before and was worried about my package since it had been a month since my order was placed. I contacted the seller concerned, and they immediately sent out another package which arrived in days. I was so happy about their patience and understanding in the situation.

For the earrings, they were exactly what I expected! I bought them for my mother for Christmas and they’re beautiful. The only thing is you have to get used to putting it in your ear, especially if you’re putting it in your second hole that you rarely put earrings in. My mom prefers them in her first hole, but I think they look beautiful in a second hole with a statement earring in the first. 

They’re not expensive at all and they come with great quality and customer service!:)

            Loved these so much, I ordered my daughter a pair after I received mine. They are very dainty and feminine looking, but well made and sturdy. I have slept in them with no issues. Have received lots of compliments! I will definitely shop with this crafter again. Thank you for such a beautiful and unique product!

            I ordered 9 pairs for my girls and only 6 arrived. I messaged the company and they were super apologetic and helpful! The earrings themselves are dainty and sweet! Excited for my girls to wear them for my 12/1/18 wedding.

            The earrings arrived fast and they look great as described. I think my ear lobes are too small for this type of ear crawler cause they don't hold it and they slip off my ear. But when on the right place they look beautiful

            I love these earrings. I have sensitive ears and these are always so comfortable. I keep them in my seconds so that I can comfortably be on the phone for work. The color combo I chose is really flattering and I was able to match it up to a necklace I already own. I love the customizable options at this shop and the quality is always worth it!

            I'm loving these earrings! Took me a little bit to get the hang of getting them in the way I liked them in the picture but, once I did they look so great!! 
I like that they were not too flimsy either. Great buy! I might have to get the other shapes too!!

            These earrings are so pretty, but the wings are not as clear as they are in the pictures -- just a little cloudy, which makes them look a little cheap. The wings are also slightly top-heavy so they  don't stay upright very easily. I still love them though!

            Item came quickly and is exactly as described. I have sensitive ears, so I can only wear many earrings for a matter of hours. The silver was high quality--I was able to keep it in all day with no problem. Lovely earring and very easy seller to work with!

"
            My ear climber finally got here! (Just a note to US purchasers she is in Israel so the timing with customs and everything is really exciting but it arrived safely and well packaged). And the designer was able to customize the bead-  instead of an opal I wanted a clear glass bead and I love it.

            Got these as a gift for my sibling—who is really artsy and hard to buy for—and they really liked them! Success! It did take a long time to arrive, but that was expected coming from Israel, and I think they still arrived on time if not earlier than projected.

            These earrings were worth the wait!! I’ve had my eye on them for a while and I’m so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn’t the shop’s fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times.

            Absolutely gorgeous earrings and super fun to wear! Seller was super friendly and made my original character so tiny and perfect! The details are incredible and very light weight, yet also very durable! Also the perfect size for my ears as I don't like chunky, hefty earrings, so I'd say they're just right. I'd give more stars if I could and I'll definitely be back for more! :)

            I have been looking for earrings for my bridesmaids.  It's been hard to find something that fits my ""vision.""  I came across Rebekas page and absolutely fell in love with her designs!  I found these earring just in hopes they would work.  They took a few weeks to come in, but TOTALLY worth the wait!  Nothing was damaged, and they were packed with care.  When I opened the box that held the earrings I melted!  They look even better than the pictures!  I took them outside in the natural sunlight, and all I can say is ""WOW!""  Now that I know they are EXACTLY what I am looking for...I will be ordering 3 more for the remaining bridesmaids!  Her work is beautiful and detailed.  Truly, some of the most beautiful pieces of jewelry I have seen in a long time!  THANK YOU!!!!

            Took me forever to find a seller who makes this type of clamp without chains, beads, etc. attached to the clamps but these are perfect! The mass amount of searching was worth it as these are exactly what I was looking for and when I recieved the two clamps I ordered, it turns out the quality is wonderful as well! Can't wait to surprise my Sir with these the next time I see him! He's going to love them for sure!

            Great earrings for my daughter. Too small for me, the mom. Can't go with minimal crawler earrings. They have to be wider in order to cover the hole.

            Super cool earrings! Very unique, very chic, and subtle, but interesting.The hoop part was a bit thinner than I thought it would be, but no matter, these are still cool earrings! Great for every day. Quick shipping was a plus! Thank you so much

            These are awesome! I'm a wildland firefighter and I wear big statement earrings in my daily life, but I've been too scared to wear any while I'm working. I love not having to worry about them getting snagged and pulled out while I'm in the woods. They stay in place and give me a little feminine touch.
        "

"
            I love these little earrings.  They're perfect for wearing everyday.  They're easy to put in.  I get lots of compliments and I've not had them that long.

            Such a great pair of earrings! I got a bonus pair of pearl earrings to wear too!
        "

"
            I still did not receive my purchase !!! So I’m not very happy!! This is the worse time I’ve had on Etsy! I saw other things I’d like from this place but not anymore. I own a manufacturing company on Illinois I would and have never treated a customer like this no matter what they receive their order on a timely manner!

            Calidad estupenda y genial diseño. Envío muy rápido. Segundo pedido y muy satisfecha.

            This has been by far one of my best purchases on Etsy. The earring itself is beautifully crafted, with a pearl which is elegant and perfectly sized. I was pleasantly surprised with the earring's weight as well. I expected it to be significantly heavier but in truth I barely notice that I have it on. The shop's owner responds fast, is extremely easy to communicate with, very friendly and puts a lot of care into packaging and posting her jewelry. She even included a beautiful necklace as a gift! Great shop, great owner, will definitely come back for more!

            Beautiful, I love it! Maybe the bar of the moon is a bit long for me and tend to hurt a little. But it is worth it ;)

            such a lovely seller to deal with. The item was just as shown in the photo and she even sent me a little present. The packaging is beautiful too!

            What an amazing purchase! This climber earring is absolutely stunning. It is so much more beautiful in real life. It is such a bonus that a matching stud is also supplied for the other ear. Highly recommend!

            Slightly smaller than photo and hole was too small for my diamond screwbacks.  Seller was very helpful though and made hole larger, but it still didn't fit, so I purchased morganite studs to pair with them instead.  It is beautiful and I get lots of compliments.

            I love the look of these and they go with any stud earrings!

            I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

I absolutely love them and can't wait to show it off.  Requesting material upgrade was not a hassle since I love my 18K!  I don't have a picture to post because I'm saving it for my birthday.

            Beautiful pink tourmaline ring in a creative eternity ring style. The gems were as perfectly matched as possible.  The craftsmanship was perfect. The ring fit just right though I will be wearing it untraditionally, I.e. not on usual ring finger. With short fingers, as I have, the ring is more comfortable on my  first finger (next to thumb). The ring is substantial and has more weight to it than some other rings. It looks and feels great. What a wonderful job this shop did. Many thanks. Note:  communications and shipping were very prompt. Picture to follow.

            It was such a pleasure working with Tanmay from Diri Jewels. He helped me created my dream ring. It is amazing quality at a very good price, and he had very quick turnaround for a custom order. I really appreciated his expertise in guiding some of the decisions I had to make. I also appreciate the fact that it came with a certificate of authenticity. I will definitely be using Tanmay for future jewelry purchases again!

            I wish I could give 10 stars because my custom made smiley face ring came out beautiful.  I ordered my ring on July 21, 2020 and received it today July 30, 2020.  What an awesome job done I mean the craftsmanship is speechless.  Looking forward to doing business with this company again all the way from California.  Thanks a million Diri Jewels.

            So so cute! It's dainty enough to wear with everything, but when it catches the light, you can see the zig-zig. Had a few compliments and couldn't recommend buy it enough!

            I purchased the snake tragus cuff, 2 star cuffs, and a necklace and I'm very happy with each item. The Tragus is comfortable & fits securely. I found that the Star cuff is slightly bendable so you can adjust it to preference and wear it higher/lower along your ear. Based on price, the good quality and the timely manner it arrived, I would definitely buy from this shop again. Thank you!
        "

"
            Shipped relatively fast! The earrings were not as round as they look in the picture. They are more oval shaped. Other than that I really like mine and almost look like the ones I lost!
        "

"
            Unfortunately the earrings didn't ""fit"" my earlobe (didn't sit flat) but the quality is great and overall they are beautiful minimal earrings.

            These are so beautiful and simple. They make any look edgy and minimalistic. I'm obsessed!

            My second product from glamrocks and I love these!
        "

"
            Nice earrings, as expected.  Nicely packaged, and I received them pretty fast.  They are very delicate- I bent them a little bit while I was cleaning them.  And  the backings are SO SMALL!!  They were really hard to get on the earring when they were in my ears.  I have never seen earring backings as tiny as these.  It's not a matter of the post being smaller than average, because I used earring backings from another pair, and they fit just fine.  
        "

"
            Love these earrings. I wanted something small and cute for a second hole piercing. These are perfect! They arrived quickly too!
        "

"
            Perfect and they look so good in my third hole travling up my whole ear
        "

"
            Super cute!
        "

"
            Absolutely love it! Its super unique and I only wore it out for about an hour and got loads of complements! It also feels super sturdy, but just bendable enough to adjust it to the ear if necessary. I got this and another pair with gold plating and it was only like a dollar more. The ship time to the US seems like forever if you're really excited for it like I was, but it was 100% worth it. Also, it took me a second to figure out how to put it in but once I got it on it didn't move or slide all day.  Im definitely ordering from this shop again whenever I'm looking for something unique. I wish I could give it 10 stars!

            I loved my earrings! They were a perfect match to my dress and got many compliments! They were also very unique and I was pleased with the order and even happier they came from Israel, my homeland. Thank you Dana for such beautiful jewelry! She was also very quick to answer and super responsive. Highly recommend!
        "

"
            I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don’t do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don’t wear earrings very often). 

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.
        "

"
            These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!

            Delivery took a little longer than I expected, but the seller was great and even offer to send another so I would get it on time. The earrings are small but lovely my 15 year old niece adores them and I have now ordered a 2nd pair for my sister. Great hypoallergenic too my niece can sleep in them without a reaction.

            So elegant looking! I can definitely wear to work.
        "

"
            Beautiful, delicate looking, yet well made. When I wore it the first time, even my husband noticed and thought they were beautiful. Customer service was stellar (my questions regarding the earrings were answered promptly, the earrings were dispatched on time).  My personal style trend towards a more classic look.  However, I noted a variety of styles for various ages and fashion sense displayed in her store. So I bought a few more pieces as Christmas gifts for my mom in law, sister and daughters and snuck another earring climber in for myself!
        "

"
            Arrived in time for my wedding, and they looked glorious! They were a little slower to ship than I'm used to from most shippers. But I won't dock stars for that because she was communicative and honest when I reached out. Plus the earrings are well made and BEAUTIFUL.

            I had wanted a pair of square, silver post earrings. These were just what I was was looking for. The hammered textured on them was a plus, makes them more interesting. Size is perfect - presentation and shipping five star too.

            These earrings were worth the wait!! I’ve had my eye on them for a while and I’m so glad I finally purchased them. It wasn’t the shop’s fault, but it did take a long time to receive them. Just be prepared to wait for them to arrive because of delays in shipping times.

            I love these earrings, they were a little weirdly big so I had to adjust the back a bit so they wouldn't fall off but other than that they look beautiful even though I don't have the best wire bending skills.

            The wire was too thick to go through my pierced ear. Nice jewelry though. I will gift them to someone.
        "

"
            Thank you for your feedback! I’m so sorry that the wires were too thick for you. We have since modified our wire to be slightly thinner so it can go through ear piercings a little easier, and yet still be strong enough to last. Excellent customer service is our goal, we’d be happy to resolve your problem to make sure you have positive experience with us.

            I loved this the moment that I saw it on instagram. At first I didn't come to the shop to look because I assumed that it would be very expensive. It was not! It is beautiful, well made, unique, just perfect! I love it even more now, it'smine! I recommend urban raven to anyone looking for a unique piece of wearable art. You won't be disappointed!

            I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

I absolutely love them and can't wait to show it off.  Requesting material upgrade was not a hassle since I love my 18K!  I don't have a picture to post because I'm saving it for my birthday.

            Beautiful pink tourmaline ring in a creative eternity ring style. The gems were as perfectly matched as possible.  The craftsmanship was perfect. The ring fit just right though I will be wearing it untraditionally, I.e. not on usual ring finger. With short fingers, as I have, the ring is more comfortable on my  first finger (next to thumb). The ring is substantial and has more weight to it than some other rings. It looks and feels great. What a wonderful job this shop did. Many thanks. Note:  communications and shipping were very prompt. Picture to follow.

            It was such a pleasure working with Tanmay from Diri Jewels. He helped me created my dream ring. It is amazing quality at a very good price, and he had very quick turnaround for a custom order. I really appreciated his expertise in guiding some of the decisions I had to make. I also appreciate the fact that it came with a certificate of authenticity. I will definitely be using Tanmay for future jewelry purchases again!

            I wish I could give 10 stars because my custom made smiley face ring came out beautiful.  I ordered my ring on July 21, 2020 and received it today July 30, 2020.  What an awesome job done I mean the craftsmanship is speechless.  Looking forward to doing business with this company again all the way from California.  Thanks a million Diri Jewels.

            The rose gold color is beautiful and it is very eye-catching and unique. The right earring was a little tight but I think I can bend it a bit and it will be fine. Love that it's comfortable enough to sleep in and doesn't irritate at all. Thanks again!

            Love these earrings, they look amazing and I've got loads of compliments on them. They're really comfortable to wear due to their being hypoallergenic titanium and you can adjust the tightness of the wires at the back which is useful. I wear these all the time
        "

"
            Had these earrings for a few months now, and I am in love with them!!!  I get compliments constantly.  I have an issue wearing any other metal in my ears other than titanium, and I can't find pretty titanium earrings anywhere else.  These are perfect!  I have them in 24/7 and have no issues.  Will definitely be purchasing more!

            I wear these in my first love. They are beautiful and fall in exactly the right place. I bought a total of three sets of earrings from this seller (all pictured in my lobes). These are the perfect combination of sparkle and opal. I’ve showered in them and worked out in them but they have no turned green. The backs fit securely and I never feel at risk of losing the earrings. I love these so much. I’ll definitely purchase more from this seller.
        "

"
            Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I’ve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they’re always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I’ll probably buy from the seller again.

I had plugs for many years and now that they have finally closed, it's still difficult to find a pair of earrings that doesn't just fall out during daily life.  These babies are staying put!  Everything I hoped for and more!!

            Beautiful! So so lightweight and perfect for everyday! They fit nicely on my my ear lobe and stay put. Beautiful craftsmanship! Will be coming back!

            The backs of the earnings took me a bit to figure out, but once I did they were fantastic. They came in a cute little bottle with a handy card on how to take care of them, which I really appreciate!

            Really love my ear cuffs. Only problem is doesn't stay put very well but still worth the price and is something unique. Plus the items came earlier than expected. Thank you so much!!!

            These earrings are better than I had imagined! I love how they do not feel too heavy on the earlobe. The hammered metal effect gives them a look that I am very satisfied with. The pictures do not do them justice. I was also so happy that they were delivered within a week!

            I loved my earrings! They were a perfect match to my dress and got many compliments! They were also very unique and I was pleased with the order and even happier they came from Israel, my homeland. Thank you Dana for such beautiful jewelry! She was also very quick to answer and super responsive. Highly recommend!

            I was shocked by how sparkly these earrings are. The pictures don’t do them justice. So beautiful and perfect for my wedding. They are comfortable and light weight (which was important to me because I don’t wear earrings very often). 

The seller was so kind and quick to respond when I had a question about the shipping. She helped to track my package which I sincerely appreciated. The earrings only arrived 2 days outside of the estimated delivery window which she warned me from the start may happen due to world-wide COVID-19 delays. Overall very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend.

            These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!

            Have always wanted earrings such as these & I was not disappointed! I can tell the gold is great quality as my ears don't itch or get irritated because I wear them nearly 24/7... even wear them to sleep & I don't even feel them. Highly recommend!!
        "

"
            Wow I am so obsessed with these earrings! I’ve been wearing my hair up a lot more during the pandemic, and I wanted something to make me look a little more put together. These Bylia earrings are absolutely perfect!

            I thought I ordered these in turquoise due to the product description but I accidentally chose ruby! I’m not a fan of pink/ruby, so I’m sure I’d like them better in a different color. They are also larger than expected, not a great fit for delicate ears. Otherwise the quality and design is very high, the seller was not very responsive to an exchange.
        "

"
            Dear customer, first of all thank you for taking the time to leave your review. I totally understand that you accidentally choose ruby instead of turquoise, but you informed me for the wrong color choice 70 days after the receipt of your earrings, which was on January 23rd, whereas I was  informed on April 2nd. 
According to my policie as well as  EU regulations, customers can  return their  orders within 14 days from day they will receive it. I hope that you understand the predicament that I was in.Thank you again for your understanding

            These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)

            I loved this the moment that I saw it on instagram. At first I didn't come to the shop to look because I assumed that it would be very expensive. It was not! It is beautiful, well made, unique, just perfect! I love it even more now, it'smine! I recommend urban raven to anyone looking for a unique piece of wearable art. You won't be disappointed!

            Like everything I have bought the picture does not do it justice! Super cute and quirky! Could not recommend urban raven enough! Gorgeous individual pieces and I am totally obsessed!!

            Really pleased with my ear climbers - they're beautiful, delicate and a bit different. Easy to put on and they stay in place and feel comfortable to wear. They're lovely quality and I really like that they're made from recycled sterling silver. They also arrived very quickly and were nicely presented. I would definitely buy from Monica again.

            I bought a pair of these, loved them so much the posts broke!!! In like, 2 days. BUT Evelyn was so generous, asked that I send them back so she can see, and she made a brand-new pair free-of-charge. Each time, she included a handwritten note which made it so personal. I felt like I was just buying lovely stuff from a friend! DO buy these earrings, they're so delicate and beautiful. Just a friendly tip, though, be sure not to bend the hooks too far out so the earrings will last a little longer. I was not so graceful the first time around but will be going forward. THANK YOU, EVELYN!!
        "

"
            Absolutely beautiful earring! Definitely came much quicker than the 2-3 weeks that it originally stated in the listing. I needed as a helix earring to replace a broken one I had been wearing, saw this earclimber and absolutely fell in love with the design. I wanted the earring to climb ""down"" instead of up, so I though it would be good to purchase the opposing ear (left earring for right ear). I messaged Evelyn and she was kind enough to give me many angles of the earring including measurements to make sure I felt like I was making the right decision. I definitely think I did! The earring came in a beautiful box with a nice gift bag and polishing cloth if you want to gift it.
        "

            Dispatched quickly and arrived earlier than expected. This is truly a beautiful earring, very unusual and sits perfectly in the ear. Very comfortable to wear and the detail is gorgeous. If you are ordering from the UK be aware that you will have to pay customs charges and that will delay receipt of the item. Royal mail charge an £8 handling fee so in total add an extra £16.69 to your purchase cost. That being said it is still very worth it for this stunning ear crawler. Very happy with this wonderful earring.
        "

"
            I purchased these for my wedding. 100000% Gorgeous. I was a little nervous about how to put these in since I have never had ear crawlers before but it was super easy. These are beautifully made, you will not regret buying them.

            Je suis extrêmement satisfait de cet achat.
La photo de l'article rend vraiment compte de l'aspect réel du bijou, la pierre est magnifique.
J'avais un peu peur que la qualité du cordon soit en décalage avec celle de la pierre mais il n'en est rien.

            I wear these in my first love. They are beautiful and fall in exactly the right place. I bought a total of three sets of earrings from this seller (all pictured in my lobes). These are the perfect combination of sparkle and opal. I’ve showered in them and worked out in them but they have no turned green. The backs fit securely and I never feel at risk of losing the earrings. I love these so much. I’ll definitely purchase more from this seller.
        "

"
            Exactly as pictured and dainty. Exactly what I wanted. I’ve bought a few pairs off Etsy and they’re always way bigger than pictured and these are so pretty and they fit my ear perfectly. I have them in my second lobe piercing, pointed towards my arch and it looks so nice. I’ll probably buy from the seller again.

            These are so dainty and sophisticated! They match my other earrings perfectly. I'm glad I shopped with Sami. Quick USPS delivery too! I got gold hoops from her shop too (pictured), they look lovely together :)

            These earrings are absolutely beautiful! I put them in my fourth holes to wrap up into my cartilage, and I love them! I also purchased two other pairs of the clusters of three (in photo), and they are really pretty! I would highly recommend!

La livraison est très rapide, les informations concernant les délais précises et SURTOUT : quel ravissement et quelle délicatesse dans les emballages (bien que sans avoir préciser qu'il s'agissait d'un cadeau).
Je vous recommande encore et encore cette créatrice. Je ne me lasse pas de son univers !

MERCI et expérience addictive garantie !

        "

"
            These are beautiful! Only note to buyers is to read the descriptions on sizing! I made the mistake of not reading and the rings ended up not being midi-sized on me, because I have very slim fingers. They fit and look beautiful on my ring finger though. Shipping was fast and the product is beautiful.
        "

"
            I love these rings so much that I need to buy another set so I can have more of them on my hands! Each ring is a slightly different size, so you can fit them on different fingers or on different segments of your finger. I love them so much!

            Beautiful jacket earrings. Only concern is that the lace is just glued on to the round back of the earring so I hope that it stays in tact. Really nice colour though I was expecting it to be a bit more red than purple-y but I guess it's a little open to one's own perception of colour. My shipment arrived in 10 days, so I was happy with that.

            bought these for my two best friends for our wedding g and I wanted a pair of my own. so beautiful on!

            Ordered 2 designs, for me and my friend. And we both love them. These are very unique and elegant. I will order more for my friends birthdays. Just a suggestion to the seller, please change the packaging.

            These sparkled in the box—almost exactly what I was looking for! They showed up fast and looked even better than the pictures. I would love these in a smaller version, too, for just the kind of earrings you can live/sleep in, and 24k gold for allergies. Close, though!
        "

"
            Absolutely gorgeous! They are very small, which I like, and for me, slightly difficult to close in my ears, but I love them. Thank you :)

            These are the perfect dainty accessory for any outfit! I absolutely love the look and fun shape of them . They’re really easy to take on and off as well and overall just feel super well made

            Love these earrings.  They are absolutely stunning and perfect for my big day! They are a bit heavier then expected (but I never wear big earrings). The have an easy to use clasp and are the perfect size.  Shipping can take a bit, but I received them in about 3 weeks. Would recommend!

            I have been looking for earrings for my bridesmaids.  It's been hard to find something that fits my ""vision.""  I came across Rebekas page and absolutely fell in love with her designs!  I found these earring just in hopes they would work.  They took a few weeks to come in, but TOTALLY worth the wait!  Nothing was damaged, and they were packed with care.  When I opened the box that held the earrings I melted!  They look even better than the pictures!  I took them outside in the natural sunlight, and all I can say is ""WOW!""  Now that I know they are EXACTLY what I am looking for...I will be ordering 3 more for the remaining bridesmaids!  Her work is beautiful and detailed.  Truly, some of the most beautiful pieces of jewelry I have seen in a long time!  THANK YOU!!!!

            So beautiful. Simple but make a statement of beauty. The price is perfect. It did take a while to get to me with the covid and the fact they had to be shipped to the U.S. from Israel. But for sure worth the wait for such reasonably priced earrings!

            They are small yet lovely.  Piece was hallmarked as requested.

            These earring are so beautiful and delicate! I get a lot of compliments. Ordering from this shop was very pleasant. They do say the shipping takes a while and when there was a problem with my shipment, they had already realized the problem and fixed it. Thank you so much!!

            Just received this item today. Absolutely love love love these beautiful earrings. The packaging was quite lovely as well. Adorable pouch for the earrings and the screw on back of cuff is so comfortable. I am a new satisfied customer and will certainly be ordering again soon! I double the 5 star rating  and give a 10.

            I'm traveling at the moment, so can't provide a photo now. But I'll try to add it when I return home. But these ear cuff earrings looks just as they did in the photo on the site. And they look fabulous on! They are adjustable where they clip at the top of the ear, and once you find the correct amount of pressure for your ear, they are remarkably comfy to wear. 

The seller boxed them up beautifully. Clearly someone who cares about her business and her customers.
        "

"
            They're beautiful! And the seller was great!! But beware if you have small ears. I do, and they're kind of big for them.

            The love and care that goes into this shop really shows in the way they do business. Thank you Jen, for the kind note, cute gift, and absolutely gorgeous earrings. You are a true artist. They are comfortable, and fit beautifully...which is normally a challenge for me.  I had plugs for many years and now that they have finally closed, it's still difficult to find a pair of earrings that doesn't just fall out during daily life.  These babies are staying put!  Everything I hoped for and more!!

            Beautiful! So so lightweight and perfect for everyday! They fit nicely on my my ear lobe and stay put. Beautiful craftsmanship! Will be coming back!

            Emma is a great artist!  I placed a custom order which included the ruffled and diamond edge in many colors, they were made, shipped, and received very quickly.  I was so impressed on their beauty that I ordered 2 more sets for my daughter-in-laws for Christmas.  They both said the same thing, ‘Gorgeous”!!  Thank you Emma, you made our Christmas extra-special, all three of us are in mix-and-match heaven, lol!

            Love, love, love these silver jackets.  I'm wearing them with the rose gold ones I bought previously and they look great, especially with pearl studs. I'm sure I'll be adding to my collection. Highly recommended!
        "

"
            These jackets are gorgeous!  I got the small ones with rims and they really make your earrings stand out.  I've had almost everyone in my office ask me where I got them - love them.  they're not your usual frumpy old jackets but also not too much.  And the packaging is a really nice touch.  It's so great to open the card and untie the jackets.

            l cannot recommend this shop highly enough! I love everything that l have purchased, including these ear jackets, and look forward to all of the new creations to come! Thanks Emma!

        "

            Beautiful. Seems to be pretty well made. I didn't realize the earrings were actually 3 separate pieces but nonetheless GREAT. They come with different types of backs so you can use the ones that feel the most secure.

            So pleased with this purchase!  They looked just like they were pictured.  Bonus my mother-in-law loved them.  Daffodils are her favorite flower, it was a birthday present. The earrings came in a cute soft minky fabric drawstring bag.  A hand written thank you card from the owners!  So nice!  The only downer, which isn't really a big deal, was the backers for the earrings.  I mean I don't know what I was expecting.  They were the clear plastic disk with metal in the center, if you wear earrings hopefully you know what I mean.  I feel like that type of backer seems cheap, but they're totally fine!  Like I said, I don't know what I was expecting.  So happy with this purchase.  Would definitely check out their stuff again for gifts.  Thanks so much Kellan and Keira!

            Awesome. awesome. soooo awesome. 
I was afraid of purchasing something internationally but omg, so pretty and sparkly. Etsy is so hit and miss with quality recently, but as soon as I opened the box my eyes lit up! So delicate and perfect.

The seller was really patient with me as I had originally came with a custom request, and we're still working on a final design, but I bought this in the meantime. 

I can't wait to buy something again!
        "

"
            Absolutely beautiful. Got it custom with flat back crew back so I can sleep comfortably on it and do not have to worry about it falling off! This is my second purchase from Rosec jewels and I'm sure it won't be my last!

            I received my order from your company. I have to tell you that I absolutely love the earring. Its is a climbing cartilage in white gold. Its never gonna come out of my ear. It's amazingly comfortable and fits me like a glove. The usual posts are so long the average earring it always spins around on my ear and I spend so much time adjusting it. I love the ease and comfort of this. Thank you for the quick delivery and the professionalism. And especially for the help with the sizing.

Sincerely
Tracy

            I love these earrings, they were a little weirdly big so I had to adjust the back a bit so they wouldn't fall off but other than that they look beautiful even though I don't have the best wire bending skills.
        "

"
            This is exactly the type of store you want to deal with! The seller was amazing and communicative throughout the whole process. The earrings were delivered ahead of schedule and were gorgeous! The photos don’t do them justice. This is a store that I would return to over and over because of their quality and service.

            The rose gold color is beautiful and it is very eye-catching and unique. The right earring was a little tight but I think I can bend it a bit and it will be fine. Love that it's comfortable enough to sleep in and doesn't irritate at all. Thanks again!

            Magnifique!
        "

"
            Love these earrings, they look amazing and I've got loads of compliments on them. They're really comfortable to wear due to their being hypoallergenic titanium and you can adjust the tightness of the wires at the back which is useful. I wear these all the time
        "

"
            Had these earrings for a few months now, and I am in love with them!!!  I get compliments constantly.  I have an issue wearing any other metal in my ears other than titanium, and I can't find pretty titanium earrings anywhere else.  These are perfect!  I have them in 24/7 and have no issues.  Will definitely be purchasing more!
        "

"
            I knew before they arrived that this pair was going to be even prettier than my last order from Diri Jewels.  They put lots of love in the making process and its flawless.

I absolutely love them and can't wait to show it off.  Requesting material upgrade was not a hassle since I love my 18K!  I don't have a picture to post because I'm saving it for my birthday.

            Beautiful pink tourmaline ring in a creative eternity ring style. The gems were as perfectly matched as possible.  The craftsmanship was perfect. The ring fit just right though I will be wearing it untraditionally, I.e. not on usual ring finger. With short fingers, as I have, the ring is more comfortable on my  first finger (next to thumb). The ring is substantial and has more weight to it than some other rings. It looks and feels great. What a wonderful job this shop did. Many thanks. Note:  communications and shipping were very prompt. Picture to follow.

            It was such a pleasure working with Tanmay from Diri Jewels. He helped me created my dream ring. It is amazing quality at a very good price, and he had very quick turnaround for a custom order. I really appreciated his expertise in guiding some of the decisions I had to make. I also appreciate the fact that it came with a certificate of authenticity. I will definitely be using Tanmay for future jewelry purchases again!

            I wish I could give 10 stars because my custom made smiley face ring came out beautiful.  I ordered my ring on July 21, 2020 and received it today July 30, 2020.  What an awesome job done I mean the craftsmanship is speechless.  Looking forward to doing business with this company again all the way from California.  Thanks a million Diri Jewels.

            I absolutely love Virginia's designs - they are simple, elegant, striking, and unique all at once. I purchased several pairs of earrings because I just couldn't pick a favorite. I cannot wear any of them without getting compliments. I'm sure I'll treat myself with more her beautiful pieces in the future and will recommend this shop to anyone who asks in the meantime. Thanks so much!

            This has become my favorite place to get ""real"" jewelry. Amazing design (I can't find anything else like it) and quality product (stands up to daily wear). I now (happily) own @ 20 pieces of Virginia Wynne's work.

            I love it. I received the rose gold, water drop pendant necklace a few days ago. Great quality, the shape was the right size (not too big or not too small), and the length of the string is also adjustable (some necklaces are too long for me). I would recommend.

            Just made another awesome purchase at Hannavanilla. I purchased a beautiful initial cubic. The variety of choices are endless and I highly recommend everyone to make ""HANNAVANILLA "" a part of special days.

            Bought the ear crawlers together with a tiny single flower earring to wear on the other ear and I couldn't be happier. They fit perfectly and are as pretty as on the pictures. Also great communication and customer care from Eleni and her team. Thank you!

            Ah beh, questo è per me! È davvero molto carino, ben fatto ed è resistente. È un oggetto particolare con colori vivaci, proprio come in foto. Ma non immaginatevi una cosa vistosa. Si fa notare con delicatezza. E di questi tempi anche i colori aiutano lo spirito! Dei venditori sono ugualmente entusiasta.

            Die Ohrringe sind toll, sehr filigran 
Es ist etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, sie einzusetzen

Ich hab die Ohrringe Anfang Dezember bestellt, sie kamen später als angekündigt (reine Versanddauer, die Versendung selbst erfolgte schneller als angegeben), was für mich unerheblich war und vielleicht auch mit der Vorweihnachtszeit zusammenhängt.
Wer aber das Paket zeitnah haben möchte, sollte wohl Expressversand zusätzlich buchen

            Earrings are lovely! The order was dispatched within a day and took just over 3 weeks to arrive in the UK. The seller was really helpful and prompt to reply when I messaged them. Overall incredibly happy.

            These are the second pair of these earrings I've bought! I'm just obsessed with these ones as I am the others. Such cute earrings, and I've gotten so many compliments.

            I received the pearl ear climbers  and very please with the craftsmanship. They are also known as ear pins. This pair has a modest and feminine characteristics about them which I will enjoy wearing. Not heavy on the ear lobe and the pin tread through the lobe is not to wide if you have a thick ear lobe.

            If I could leave 10 stars I would. I ordered these for my wedding and they were perfect. Will cherish these earrings always.

            THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.  I ORDERED ANOTHER PAIR IN GOLD

            These bracelets were exactly as pictured, dainty, and super cute!! I purchased them as thank you gifts and they fit all of my friends perfectly (I bought 3) and we all have teeny wrists. The colors were pretty and the bracelet feels sturdy. Shipping and working with the shop owner was easy and the packaging was adorable! Will definitely shop here again!! (I'm repeating my reviews for all 3 bracelets)

            I am very happy! I bought these because they are climbers, and I wanted to use them to hide my second lobe piercing. (The second ones was- regrettably- not done professionally and ended up leaving lopsided scarring) they hide the scars very well. And on the plus side they are inexpensive and unique! The shipping took a bit longer then I was expecting but they were worth the wait!

            I had a great experience with HarshandSweet.  The items I received were as expected and even better.  These ear climbers are absolutely adorable and the one thing I was most impressed with was that they stay in place so much better than others I've purchased.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend them.

            I loved this the moment that I saw it on instagram. At first I didn't come to the shop to look because I assumed that it would be very expensive. It was not! It is beautiful, well made, unique, just perfect! I love it even more now, it'smine! I recommend urban raven to anyone looking for a unique piece of wearable art. You won't be disappointed!

            I was so excited to get these! As soon as my tracking app said it was delivered, I raced to the mailbox and ripped the package open! These earrings are GORGEOUS!! I love them so much and they look so good in my piercings. I want to wear these and the other earring purchase from Trium at the same time if I could haha! But I only have to piercing holes, so I’ll have to alternate. Crisan was very kind and understanding about the shipping issues, which wasn’t his fault of course, during this pandemic.

            An appreciative and big ""WOW"" is the first reaction I had when I received my first pair (but definitely not my last!) of Kathy's gorgeus creations.  They are wonderful, light weight, beautiful and well -- just fun!  Plus, as her shop descriptions explain so well, they can be worn in so many different ways so you are really getting far more than just one pair of earrings.  While the product is what you are purchasing, Kathy's caring, prompt and wonderful service is among the best of the best. Ditto the eye-catching packaging too. Thank you, Kathy, for being there and for sharing your amazing talents with all fortunate enough to cross paths with you and your great Etsy shop!

            They came and they were absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately, poor lasting quality. I never got to wear them. 2 months later, without ever being worn, without ever getting wet, the silver looks like it eroded right off and theyre turning brown like what happens with really cheap material, usually over time too not just 2 months. I will never be able to wear them and it was a waste. The stars are for how just freaking pretty they were when they came.

            I love this ear climber. Love! It’s delicate, but has a nice presence on the ear. Very lightweight. I sleep with it in, without issue. Highly recommend!

            These earrings are beautiful and exactly what I wanted! They make a statement but are still dainty enough for every day. Highly recommend!

            This is the second one I’ve bought and it’s just as great! Opted for the full gold so I can wear it daily with ease in my cartilage piercing. It’s perfect!

            Very nice. My GF really liked these. But you do have to master how to form them in your ear so they don’t dangle.

            I bought these for my wedding in 4 months, they were really expensive but when I got them in person the quality is amazing and they’re so beautiful I don’t even care that the price was so high. I’m beyond excited to wear these in my hair the day of the wedding! Highly recommend! :)

            I loved my earrings! They were a perfect match to my dress and got many compliments! They were also very unique and I was pleased with the order and even happier they came from Israel, my homeland. Thank you Dana for such beautiful jewelry! She was also very quick to answer and super responsive. Highly recommend!

            These are exactly as pictured and turned out perfect! I plan on wearing these for my wedding in September and they are the perfect size and sparkle. I love the cluster and jacket style of this earring. I found a lot of others I liked on Etsy, but all of them were too big, too ornate, and would take away from the rest of me. These, are gorgeous!! I am so excited to wear these on my wedding day. Thank you!
